<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> subject of the supernatural in modern English
fiction has been found difficult to deal with because
of its wealth of material. While there has been no
previous book on the topic, and none related to it, save
Mr. C.&nbsp;E. Whitmore&rsquo;s work on <cite>The Supernatural in Tragedy</cite>,
the mass of fiction itself introducing ghostly or psychic
motifs is simply enormous. It is manifestly impossible
to discuss, or even to mention, all of it. Even in my
bibliography which numbers over three thousand titles, I
have made no effort to list all the available examples of the
type. The bibliography, which I at first intended to
publish in connection with this volume, is far too voluminous
to be included here, so will probably be brought out
later by itself.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible for me to prosecute the
research work or to write the book save for the assistance
generously given by many persons. I am indebted to the
various officials of the libraries of Columbia University
and of New York City, particularly to Miss Isadore Mudge,
Reference Librarian of Columbia, and to the authorities
of the New York Society Library for permission to use
their priceless out-of-print novels in the Kennedy Collection.
My interest in English fiction was increased
during my attendance on some courses in the history
of the English novel, given by Dr. A.&nbsp;J. Carlyle, in Oxford
University, England, several years ago. I have received
helpful bibliographical suggestions from Professor Blanche
Colton Williams, Dr. Dorothy Brewster, Professor Nelson
Glenn McCrea, Professor John Cunliffe, and Dean Talcott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Williams, of Columbia, and Professor G.&nbsp;L. Kittredge, of
Harvard. Professors William P. Trent, George Philip
Krapp, and Ernest Hunter Wright very kindly read
the book in manuscript and gave valuable advice concerning
it, Professor Wright going over the material with
me in detail. But my chief debt of gratitude is to
Professor Ashley H. Thorndike, Head of the Department
of English and Comparative Literature in Columbia,
whose stimulating criticism and kindly encouragement
have made the book possible. To all of these&mdash;and
others&mdash;who have aided me, I am deeply grateful, and
I only wish that the published volume were more worthy
of their assistance.</p>

<h2 class="frst">INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> supernatural is an ever-present force in literature.
It colors our poetry, shapes our epics and dramas,
and fashions our prose till we are so wonted to it
that we lose sense of its wonder and magic. If all the
elements of the unearthly were removed from our books,
how shrunken in value would seem the residue, how
forlorn our feelings! Lafcadio Hearn in the recently
published volume, <cite>Interpretations of Literature</cite>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>There is scarcely any great author in European literature,
old or new, who has not distinguished himself in his treatment
of the supernatural. In English literature I believe there is
no exception from the time of the Anglo-Saxon poets to
Shakespeare, and from Shakespeare to our own day. And this
introduces us to the consideration of a general and remarkable
fact, a fact that I do not remember to have seen in any
books, but which is of very great philosophical importance:
there is something ghostly in all great art, whether of literature,
music, sculpture, or architecture. It touches something
within us that relates to infinity.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>This continuing presence of the weird in literature shows
the popular demand for it and must have some basis in
human psychosis. The night side of the soul attracts us
all. The spirit feeds on mystery. It lives not by fact
alone but by the unknowable, and there is no highest
mystery without the supernatural. Man loves the
frozen touch of fear, and realizes pure terror only when
touched by the unmortal. The hint of spectral sounds or
presences quickens the imagination as no other suggestion
can do, and no human shapes of fear can awe the soul as
those from beyond the grave. Man&rsquo;s varying moods
create heaven, hell, and faery wonder-lands for him, and
people them with strange beings.</p>

<p>Man loves the supernatural elements in literature
perhaps because they dignify him by giving his existence
a feeling of infinity otherwise denied. They grant him a
sense of being the center of powers more than earthly, of
conflicts supermortal. His own material life may be
however circumscribed and trivial yet he can loose his
fancy and escape the petty tragedies of his days by flight
beyond the stars. He can widen the tents of his mortal
life, create a universe for his companionship, and marshal
the forces of demons and unknown gods for his commands.
To his narrow rut he can join the unspaced firmament; to
his trivial hours add eternity; to his finite, infinity. He
is so greedy of power, and has so piteously little that he
must look for his larger life in dreams and in the literature
of the supernatural.</p>

<p>But, whatever be the reasons, there has been a continuity
of the ghostly in literature, with certain rise and
fall of interest. There is in modern English fiction, as
likewise in poetry and the drama, a great extent of the
supernatural, with wide diversity of elements. Beginning
with the Gothic romance, that curious architectural
excrescence that yet has had enormous influence on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
novel, the supernatural is found in every period and in
every form of fiction. The unearthly beings meet us in
all guises, and answer our every mood, whether it be
serious or awed, satiric or humoresque.</p>

<p>Literature, always a little ahead of life, has formed our
beliefs for us, made us free with spirits, and given us
entrance to immortal countries. The sense of the unearthly
is ever with us, even in the most commonplace
situations,&mdash;and there is nothing so natural to us as the
supernatural. Our imagination, colored by our reading,
reveals and transforms the world we live in. We are
aware of unbodied emotions about us, of discarnate
moods that mock or invite us. We go a-ghosting now in
public places, and a specter may glide up to give us an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apologia pro vita sua</i> any day in Grand Central or on Main
Street of Our-Town. We chat with fetches across the
garden fence and pass the time of day with demons by
way of the dumb-waiter. That gray-furred creature that
glooms suddenly before us in the winter street is not a
chauffeur, but a were-wolf questing for his prey. Yon
whirring thing in the far blue is not an aeroplane but
a hippogriff that will presently alight on the pavement
beside us with thundering golden hoofs to bear us away
to distant lovely lands where we shall be untroubled by
the price of butter or the articles lost in last week&rsquo;s wash.
That sedate middle-aged ferry that transports us from
Staten Island is a magic Sending Boat if only we knew
its potent runes! The old woman with the too-pink
cheeks and glittering eye, that presses August bargains
upon us with the argument that they will be in style
for early fall wear, is a witch wishful to lure away our
souls. We may pass at will by the guardian of the narrow
gate and traverse the regions of the Under-world. True,
the materialist may argue that the actual is more marvelous
than the imagined, that the aeroplane is more a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
thing of wonder than was the hippogriff, that the ferry
is really the enchanted boat, after all, and that Dante
would write a new <cite>Inferno</cite> if he could see the subway at
the rush hour, but that is another issue.</p>

<p>We might have more psychal experiences than we do if
we would only keep our eyes open, but most of us do have
more than we admit to the neighbors. We have an early-Victorian
reticence concerning ghostly things as if it were
scandalous to be associated with them. But that is all
wrong. We should be proud of being singled out for
spectral confidences and should report our ghost-guests
to the society columns of the newspaper. It is hoped that
this discussion of comparative ghost-lore may help to
establish a better sense of values.</p>

<p>In this book I deal with ghosts and devils by and large,
in an impressionistic way. I don&rsquo;t know much about
them; I have no learned theories of causation. I only
love them. I only marvel at their infinite variety and am
touched by their humanity, their likeness to mortals. I
am fond of them all, even the dejected, dog-eared ghosts
that look as if they were wraiths of poor relations left
out in the rain all night, or devils whose own mothers
wouldn&rsquo;t care for them. It gives me no holier-than-thou
feeling of horror to sit beside a vampire in the subway, no
panic to hear a banshee shut up in a hurdy-gurdy box.
I give a cordial how-do-you-do when a dragon glides up
and puts his paw in mine, and in every stray dog I recognize
a Gladsome Beast. Like us mortals, they all need
sympathy, none more so than the poor wizards and bogles
that are on their own, as the Scotch say.</p>

<p>While discussing the nineteenth century as a whole,
I have devoted more attention to the fiction of the supernatural
in the last thirty years or so, because there has
been much more of it in that time than before. There is
now more interest in the occult, more literature produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
dealing with psychal powers than ever before in our history.
It is apparent in poetry, in the drama, the novel,
and the short story. I have not attempted, even in
my bibliography, to include all the fiction of the type,
since that would be manifestly impossible. I have,
however, mentioned specimens of the various forms, and
have listed the more important examples. The
treatment here is meant to be suggestive rather than
exhaustive and seeks to show that there is a genuine
revival of wonder in our time, with certain changes in the
characterization of supernatural beings. It includes not
only the themes that are strictly supernatural, but also
those which, formerly considered unearthly, carry on the
traditions of the magical. Much of our material of the
weird has been rationalized, yet without losing its effect
of wonder for us in fact or in fiction. If now we study
a science where once men believed blindly in a Black
Art, is the result really less mysterious?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="stl">The Gothic Romance</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> real precursor of supernaturalism in modern
English literature was the Gothic novel. That
odd form might be called a brief in behalf of
banished romance, since it voiced a protest against the
excess of rationalism and realism in the early eighteenth
century. Too great correctness and restraint must always
result in proportionate liberty. As the eternal swing of
the pendulum of literary history, the ebb and flow of
fiction inevitably bring a reaction against any extreme,
so it was with the fiction of the period. The mysterious
twilights of medievalism invited eyes tired of the noonday
glare of Augustan formalism. The natural had become
familiar to monotony, hence men craved the supernatural.
And so the Gothic novel came into being. <em>Gothic</em> is here
used to designate the eighteenth-century novel of terror
dealing with medieval materials.</p>

<p>There had been some use of the weird in English fiction
before Horace Walpole, but the terror novel proper is
generally conceded to begin with his Romantic curiosity,
<cite>The Castle of Otranto</cite>. The Gothic novel marks a distinct
change in the form of literature in which supernaturalism
manifests itself. Heretofore the supernatural elements
have appeared in the drama, in the epic, in ballads and
other poetry, and in folk-tales, but not noticeably in the
novel. Now, however, for a considerable time the ghostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
themes are most prominent in lengthy fiction, contrasted
with the short story which later is to supersede it as a
vehicle for the weird. This vacillation of form is a distinct
and interesting aspect of the development of supernaturalism
in literature and will be discussed later.</p>

<p>With this change in form comes a corresponding change
in the materials of ghostly narration. Poetry in general
in all times has freely used the various elements of supernaturalism.
The epic has certain distinct themes, such
as visits to the lower world, visions of heaven, and conflict
between mortal and divine powers, and brings in mythological
characters, gods, goddesses, demigods, and the
like. Fate is a moving figure in the older dramas, while
the liturgical plays introduced devils, angels, and even the
Deity as characters in the action. In the classical and
Elizabethan drama we see ghosts, witches, magicians,
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>. Medieval romances, prose as well
as metrical and alliterative, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansons de geste</i>, <i lang="br" xml:lang="br">lais</i>, and
so forth, drew considerably on the supernatural for complicating
material in various forms, and undoubtedly much
of our present element comes from medievalism. Tales
of the Celtic Otherworld, of fairy-lore, of magic, so popular
in early romance, show a strong revival to-day.</p>

<p>The Gothic novel is more closely related to the drama
than to the epic or to such poetry as <cite>The Faerie Queene</cite>
or <cite>Comus</cite>. On the other hand, the later novels and stories,
while less influenced by the dramatic tradition, show more
of the epic trace than does the Gothic romance. The epic
tours through heaven and hell, the lavish use of angels,
devils, and even of Deity, the introduction of mythological
characters and figures which are not seen in Gothic fiction,
appear to a considerable extent in the stories of recent
times. In Gothicism we find that the Deity disappears
though the devil remains. There are no vampires, so far
as I have been able to find, though the were-wolf and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
lycanthrope appear, which were absent from the drama
(save in <cite>The Duchess of Malfi</cite>). Other elements are seen,
such as the beginnings of the scientific supernaturalism
which is to become so prominent in later times. The
Wandering Jew comes in and the elixir of life and the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone achieve importance. Mechanical supernaturalism
and the uncanny power given to inanimate
objects seem to have their origins here, to be greatly
developed further on. Supernaturalism associated with
animals, related both to the mythological stories of the
past and to the more horrific aspects of later fiction, are
noted in the terror romance.</p>

<p>Allegory and symbolism are present in a slight degree,
as in <cite>Melmoth</cite> and Vathek&rsquo;s Hall of Eblis, though not
emphasized as in more modern literature. Humor is
largely lacking in the Gothic romance, save as the writers
furnish it unintentionally. In Gothicism itself we have
practically no satire, though Jane Austen and Barrett
satirize the terror novel itself in delicious burlesques that
laugh it out of court.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">Elements of Gothicism.</h3> <p class="inline">In the terror tale the relationship
between supernatural effect and Gothic architecture,
scenery, and weather is strongly stressed. Everything is
ordered to fit the Gothic plan, and the conformity becomes
in time conventionally monotonous. Horace Walpole,
the father of the terror novel, had a fad for medievalism,
and he expressed his enthusiasm in that extraordinary
building at Strawberry Hill, courteously called a Gothic
castle. From a study of Gothic architecture was but a
step to the writing of romance that should reproduce the
mysteries of feudal times, for the shadows of ancient,
gloomy castles and cloisters suggested the shades of
ghost-haunted fiction, of morbid terrors. <cite>The Castle of
Otranto</cite> was the outcome of a dream suggested by the
author&rsquo;s thinking about medieval structures.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The Gothic castle itself is represented as possessing
all the antique glooms that increase the effect of mystery
and awe, and its secret passage-ways, its underground
vaults and dungeons, its trap-doors, its mouldy, spectral
chapel, form a fit setting for the unearthly visitants that
haunt it. A feudal hall is the suitable domicile for ghosts
and other supernatural revenants, and the horrific
romance throughout shows a close kinship with its architecture.
The novels of the class invariably lay their
scenes in medieval buildings, a castle, a convent, a monastery,
a château or abbey, or an inquisitional prison.
The harassed heroine is forever wandering through
midnight corridors of Gothic structure. And indeed, the
opportunity for unearthly phenomena is much more
spacious in the vast piles of antiquity than in our bungalows
or apartment-houses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe erected many ruinous structures in
fiction. Her <cite>Mysteries of Udolpho</cite> shows a castle, a
convent, a château, all Gothic in terror and gloomy
secrets, with rooms hung with rotting tapestry, or wainscoted
with black larch-wood, with furniture dust-covered
and dropping to pieces from age, with palls of black velvet
waving in the ghostly winds. In other romances she
depicts decaying castles with treacherous stairways
leading to mysterious rooms, halls of black marble, and
vaults whose great rusty keys groan in the locks. One
heroine says:<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> &ldquo;When I entered the portals of this Gothic
structure a chill&mdash;surely prophetic&mdash;chilled my veins,
pressed upon my heart, and scarcely allowed me to
breathe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite>The Ancient Records of the Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswyth</cite><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
says of its setting: &ldquo;The damp, cold, awe-inspiring hall
seemed to conjure up ten thousand superstitious horrors
and terrific imaginary apparitions.&rdquo; In Maturin&rsquo;s <cite>Albigenses</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the knights assemble round the great fire in the
baronial hall and tell ghost tales while the storm rages
outside. In <cite>Melmoth, the Wanderer</cite> the scene changes
often, yet it is always Gothic and terrible,&mdash;the monastery
with its diabolical punishments, the ancient castle, the
ruined abbey by which the wanderer celebrates his
marriage at midnight with a dead priest for the celebrant,
the madhouse, the inquisition cells, which add gloom
and horror to the supernatural incidents and characters.
In <cite>Zofloya</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the maiden is imprisoned in an underground
cave similar to that boasted by other castles. This novel
is significant because of the freedom with which Shelley
appropriated its material for his <cite>Zastrozzi</cite>, which likewise
has the true Gothic setting. In Shelley&rsquo;s other romance
he erects the same structure and has the devil meet his
victim by the desolate, dear old Gothic abbey.</p>

<p>Regina Maria Roche wrote a number of novels built
up with crumbling castles, awesome abbeys, and donjon-keeps
whose titles show the architectural fiction that
dominates them. A list of the names of the Gothic novels
will serve to show the general importance laid on antique
setting. In fact, the castle, abbey, monastery, château,
convent, or inquisition prison occupied such an important
place in the story that it seemed the leading character.
It dominated the events and was a malignant personality,
that laid its spell upon those within its bounds. It shows
something of the character that Hawthorne finally gives
to his house of seven gables, or the brooding, relentless
power of the sea in Synge&rsquo;s drama.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The ancient castle
becomes not merely haunted itself but is the haunter as
well.</p>

<p>Not only is architecture made subservient to the needs
of Gothic fiction, but the scenery likewise is adapted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
fit it. Before Mrs. Radcliffe wrote her stories interlarded
with nature descriptions, scant notice had been paid to
scenery in the novel. But she set the style for morose
landscapes as Walpole had for glooming castles, and the
succeeding romances of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i> combined both features.
Mrs. Radcliffe was not at all hampered by the fact that
she had never laid eyes on the scenes she so vividly pictures.
She painted the dread scenery of awesome mountains
and forests, beetling crags and dizzy abysses with
fluent and fervent adjectives, and her successors imitated
her in sketching nature with dark impressionism.</p>

<p>The scenery in general in the Gothic novel is always
subjectively represented. Nature in itself and of itself
is not the important thing. What the writer seeks to do
is by descriptions of the outer world to emphasize the
mental states of man, to reflect the moods of the characters,
and to show a fitting background for their crimes and
unearthly experiences. There is little of the light of day,
of the cheerfulness of ordinary nature, but only the scenes
and phenomena that are in harmony with the glooms of
crimes and sufferings.</p>

<p>Like the scenery, the weather in the Gothic novel is
always subjectively treated. There is ever an artistic
harmony between man&rsquo;s moods and the atmospheric
conditions. The play of lightning, supernatural thunders,
roaring tempests announce the approach and operations
of the devil, and ghosts walk to the accompaniment of
presaging tempests. In <cite>The Albigenses</cite> the winds are
diabolically possessed and laugh fiendishly instead of
moaning as they do as seneschals in most romances of
terror. The storms usually take place at midnight, and
there is rarely a peaceful night in Gothic fiction. The
stroke of twelve generally witnesses some uproar of nature
as some appearance of restless spirit. Whenever the
heroines in Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s tales start on their midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ramble through subterranean passages and halls of horror,
the barometer becomes agitated. And another<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> says:
&ldquo;The storm, that at that moment was tremendous, could
not equal that tempest which passed in the thoughts of
the unhappy captive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In <cite>Zofloya</cite> Victoria&rsquo;s meetings in the forest with the
Moor, who is really the devil in disguise, are accompanied
by supernatural manifestations of nature. The weather
is ordered to suit the dark, unholy plots they make, and
they plan murders against a background of black clouds,
hellish thunder, and lurid lightning. When at last the
Moor announces himself as the devil and hurls Victoria
from the mountain top, a sympathetic storm arises and
a flood sweeps her body into the river. This scene is
accusingly like the one in the last chapter of Lewis&rsquo;s
<cite>Monk</cite>, where the devil throws Ambrosio from the cliff
to the river&rsquo;s brink.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Instantly a violent storm arose; the winds in fury rent up
rocks and forests; the sky was now black with clouds, now
sheeted with fire; the rain fell in torrents; it swelled the stream,
the waves over-flowed their banks; they reached the spot
where Ambrosio lay, and, when they abated, carried with
them into the river the corse of the despairing monk.</p>
</div>

<p>No Gothic writer shows more power of harmonizing
the tempests of the soul with the outer storms than does
Charles Robert Maturin.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> As Melmoth, doomed to
dreadful life till he can find some tortured soul willing to
exchange destinies with him, traverses the earth in his
search, the preternatural aspects of weather both reflect
and mock his despair. As the young nephew alone at
midnight after his uncle&rsquo;s death reads the fated manuscript,
&ldquo;cloud after cloud comes sweeping on like the
dark banners of an approaching host whose march is for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
destruction.&rdquo; Other references may illustrate the motif.
&ldquo;Clouds go portentously off like ships of war ... to
return with added strength and fury.&rdquo; &ldquo;The dark and
heavy thunder-clouds that advance slowly seem like the
shrouds of specters of departed greatness. Peals of
thunder sounded, every peal like the exhausted murmurs
of a spent heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In general, in the Gothic novel there is a decided and
definite attempt to use the terrible forces of nature to
reflect the dark passions of man, with added suggestiveness
where supernatural agencies are at work in the
events. This becomes a distinct convention, used with
varying effectiveness. Nowhere in the fiction of the
period is there the power such as Shakespeare reveals, as
where Lear wanders on the heath in the pitiless clutch of
the storm, with a more tragic tempest in his soul. Yet,
although the idea of the inter-relation of the passions of
man and nature is not original with the Gothicists, and
though they show little of the inevitability of genius, they
add greatly to their supernatural effect by this method.
Later fiction is less barometric as less architectural than
the Gothic.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">The Origin of Individual Gothic Tales.</h3> <p class="inline">The psychological
origin of the individual Gothic romances is interesting
to note. Supernaturalism was probably more generally
believed in then than now, and people were more given to
the telling of ghost stories and all the folk-tales of terror
than at the present time. One reason for this may be that
they had more leisure; and their great open fires were more
conducive to the retailing of romances of shudders than
our unsocial steam radiators. The eighteenth century
seemed frankly to enjoy the pleasures of fear, and the rise
of the Gothic novel gave rein to this natural love for the
uncanny and the gruesome.</p>
</div>

<p>Dreams played an important part in the inspiration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the tales of terror. The initial romance was, as the
author tells us, the result of an architectural nightmare.
Walpole says in a letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Shall I even confess to you what was the origin of this
romance? I waked one morning from a dream, of which all
that I could recall was that I had thought myself in an ancient
castle (a very natural dream for a head filled like mine with
Gothic story) and that at the uppermost banister of a great
staircase I saw a gigantic hand in armor. In the evening I
sat down and began to write, without knowing in the least
what I intended to say or relate. The work grew on my hands.</p>
</div>

<p>Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <cite>Frankenstein</cite> was likewise born of a
dream. &ldquo;Monk&rdquo; Lewis had interested Byron, Polidori,
and the Shelleys in supernatural tales so much so that
after a fireside recital of German terror stories Byron
proposed that each member of the group should write
a ghostly romance to be compared with the compositions
of the others. The results were negligible save <cite>Frankenstein</cite>,
and it is said that Byron was much annoyed that a
mere girl should excel him. At first Mrs. Shelley was
unable to hit upon a plot, but one evening after hearing
a discussion of Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s attempts to create life
by laboratory experiments, she had an idea in a half
waking dream. She says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I saw&mdash;with shut eyes but acute mental vision&mdash;I saw the
pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he
had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man
stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful
engine, show signs of life.... The artist sleeps but he is
awakened; and behold, the horrid thing stands at his bedside,
looking on him with watery, yellow yet speculative eyes!</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">And from this she wrote her story of the man-monster.</p>

<p>The relation of dreams to the uncanny tale is interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Dreams and visions, revelatory of the past and prophetic
of the future, played an important part in the drama
(as they are now widely used in motion-picture scenarios)
and the Gothic novel continues the tradition. It
would be impossible to discover in how many instances
the authors were subconsciously influenced in their
choice of material by dreams. The presaging dreams and
visions attributed to supernatural agency appear frequently
in Gothic fiction. The close relation between
dreams and second sight in the terror novel might form
an interesting by-path for investigation. Dream-supernaturalism
becomes even more prominent in later fiction
and contributes passages of extraordinary power of which
De Quincey&rsquo;s <cite>Dream-Fugue</cite> may be mentioned as an
example.</p>

<p>The germinal idea for <cite>Melmoth, the Wanderer</cite> was
contained in a paragraph from one of the author&rsquo;s own
sermons, which suggested a theme for the story of a
doomed, fate-pursued soul.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>At this moment is there one of us present, however we may
have departed from the Lord, disobeyed His will, and disregarded
His word&mdash;is there one of us who would, at this
moment, accept all that man could bestow or earth could
afford, to resign the hope of his salvation? No, there is not
one&mdash;not such a fool on earth were the enemy of mankind to
traverse it with the offer!</p>
</div>

<p>True, the theme of such devil-pact had appeared in
folk-tales and in the drama previously, notably in Marlowe&rsquo;s
<cite>Doctor Faustus</cite>, but Maturin here gives the idea a
dramatic twist and psychologic poignancy by making a
human being the one to seek to buy another&rsquo;s soul to save
his own. A mortal, cursed with physical immortality,
ceaselessly harried across the world by the hounds of
fate, forever forced by an irresistible urge to make his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
impitiable offer to tormented souls, and always meeting
a tragic refusal, offers dramatic possibilities of a high order
and Maturin&rsquo;s story has a dreadful power.</p>

<p>Clara Reeve&rsquo;s avowed purpose in writing <cite>The Old
English Baron</cite> was to produce a ghost story that should
be more probable and realistic than Walpole&rsquo;s. She
stated that her book was the literary offspring of the
earlier romance, though Walpole disclaimed the paternity.
She deplored the violence of the supernatural machinery
that tended to defeat its own impressiveness and wished
to avoid that danger in her work, though she announced:
&ldquo;We can conceive and allow for the appearance of a
ghost.&rdquo; Her prim recipe for Romantic fiction required,
&ldquo;a certain degree of the marvelous to excite the attention;
enough of the manners of real life to give an air of probability
to the work; and enough of the pathetic to engage
the heart in its behalf.&rdquo; But her ingredients did not mix
well and the result was rather indigestible though devoured
by hungry readers of her time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Anne Radcliffe, that energetic manipulator of
Gothic enginery, wrote because she had time that was
wasting on her hands,&mdash;which may be an explanation for
other and later literary attempts. Her journalist husband
was away till late at night, so while sitting up for him she
wrote frightful stories to keep herself from being scared.
During that waiting loneliness she doubtless experienced
all those nervous terrors that she describes as being undergone
by her palpitating maidens, whose emotional anguish
is suffered in midnight wanderings through subterranean
passages and ghosted apartments. There is one report
that she went mad from over-much brooding on mormo,
but that is generally discredited.</p>

<p>Matthew Gregory Lewis was impelled to write <cite>The
Monk</cite> by reading the romances of Walpole and Mrs.
Radcliffe, together with Schiller&rsquo;s <cite>Robbers</cite>, which triple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
influence is discernible in his lurid tale. He defended the
indecency of his book by asserting that he took the plot
from a story in <cite>The Guardian</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> ingeniously intimating
that plagiarized immorality is less reprehensible than
original material. Shelley, in his turn, was so strongly
impressed by Lewis&rsquo;s <cite>Monk</cite>, and Mrs. Dacre&rsquo;s <cite>Zofloya</cite> in
writing his <cite>Zastrozzi</cite>, and by William Godwin&rsquo;s <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leon</cite>
in his <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Irvyne, or The Rosicrucian</cite>, that the adaptation
amounts to actual plagiarism. Even the titles show
imitation. In writing to Godwin, Shelley said he was &ldquo;in
a state of intellectual sickness&rdquo; when he wrote these
stories, and no one who is familiar with the productions
will contradict him in the matter.</p>

<p>The influence of the crude scientific thought and investigation
of the eighteenth century is apparent in the
Gothic novels. <cite>Frankenstein</cite>, as we have seen, was the
outcome of a Romantic, Darwinian dream, and novels by
Godwin, Shelley, and Maturin deal with the theme of the
elixir of life. William Beckford&rsquo;s <cite>Vathek</cite> has to do with
alchemy, sorcery, and other phases of supernatural science.
Zofloya, Mrs. Dacre&rsquo;s diabolical Moor, performs experiments
in hypnotism, telepathy, sorcery, and satanic
chemistry. And so in a number of the imitative and less
known novels of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i> science plays a part in furnishing
the material. There is much interest in the study of
the relation of science to the literature of supernaturalism
in the various periods and the discoveries of modern
times as furnishing plot material. The Gothic contribution
to this form of ghostly fiction is significant, though
slight in comparison with later developments.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">The Gothic Ghosts.</h3> <p class="inline">The Ghost is the real hero or heroine
of the Gothic novel. The merely human characters
become for the reader colorless and dull the moment a
specter glides up and indicates a willingness to relate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the story of his life. The continuing popularity of the
shade in literature may be due to the fact that humanity
finds fear one of the most pleasurable of emotions and
truly enjoys vicarious horrors, or it may be due to a childish
delight in the sensational. At all events, the ghost
haunts the pages of terror fiction, and the trail of the
supernatural is over them all. In addition to its association
with ancient superstitions, survivals of animistic
ideas in primitive culture, we may see the classical and
Elizabethan influence in the Gothic specter. The prologue-ghost,
naturally, is not needed in fiction, but
the revenge-ghost is as prominent as ever. The ghost
as a dramatic personage, his talkativeness, his share in
the action, reflect the dramatic tradition, with a strong
Senecan touch. The Gothic phantoms have not the
power of Shakespeare&rsquo;s apparitions, nothing approaching
the psychologic subtlety of <cite>Hamlet</cite> or <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> or the
horrific suggestiveness of <cite>Macbeth</cite>, yet they are related
to them and are not altogether poor. Though imitative
of the dramatic ghosts they have certain characteristics
peculiar to themselves and are greatly worth consideration
in a study of literary supernaturalism.</p>
</div>

<p>There are several clearly marked classes of ghosts in
Gothicism. There is the real ghost that anybody can
pin faith to; there is the imagined apparition that is only
a figment of hysterical fear or of a guilty conscience; and
there is the deliberate hoax specter. There are ghosts
that come only when called,&mdash;sometimes the castle
dungeons have to be paged for retiring shades; others appear
of their own free will. Some have a local habitation
and a name and haunt only their own proper premises,
while others have the wanderlust. There are innocent
spirits returning to reveal the circumstances of their
violent demise and to ask Christian burial; we meet guilty
souls sent back to do penance for their sins in the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of their commission; and there are revenge ghosts of
multiple variety. There are specters that yield to prayers
and strong-minded shades that resist exorcism. It is
difficult to classify them, for the lines cross inextricably.</p>

<p>The genealogical founder of the family of Gothic ghosts
is the giant apparition in <cite>The Castle of Otranto</cite>. He
heralds his coming by an enormous helmet, a hundred
times larger than life size, which crashes into the hall, and
a sword which requires a hundred men to bear it in. The
ghost himself appears in sections. We first see a Brobdignagian
foot and leg, with no body, then a few chapters
later an enormous hand to match. In the last scene he
assembles his parts, after the fashion of an automobile
demonstration, supplies the limbs that are lacking and
stands forth as an imposing and portentous shade. After
receiving Alfonso&rsquo;s specter&mdash;Alfonso will be remembered
as the famous statue afflicted with the nose-bleed&mdash;he
&ldquo;is wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.&rdquo; That
seems singular, considering the weighty material of which
he and his armor are made. There is another interesting
specter in the castle, the monk who is seen kneeling in
prayer in the gloomy chapel and who, &ldquo;turning slowly
round discovers to Frederick the fleshless jaws and
empty sockets of a skeleton wrapped in a hermit&rsquo;s
cowl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clara Reeve&rsquo;s young peasant in <cite>The Old English Baron</cite>,
the unrecognized heir to the estate, who is spending a
night in the haunted apartment, sees two apparitions, one
a woman and the other a gentleman in armor though not
of such appalling size as the revenant in <cite>Otranto</cite>. The
two announce themselves as his long-lost parents and
vanish after he is estated and suitably wed. Mrs. Radcliffe<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
introduces the shade of a murdered knight, a
chatty personage who haunts a baronial hall full of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and at another time engages in a tournament, slaying his
opponent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonhote<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> shows us a migratory ghost of whom the
old servant complains in vexation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Only think, Miss, of a ghost that should be at home minding
its own business at the Baron&rsquo;s own castle, taking the trouble
to follow him here on special business it has to communicate!
However, travelling three or four hundred miles is nothing to a
ghost that can, as I have heard, go at the rate of a thousand
miles a minute on land or sea.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">In this romance the baron goes to visit the vault and has
curdling experiences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A deep groan issues from the coffin and a voice exclaims,
&lsquo;You hurt me! Forbear or you will crush my bones
to powder!&rsquo;&rdquo; He knocks the coffin in pieces, whereupon
the vocal bones demand decent burial and his departure
from the castle. Later the baron sees the ghost of his
first wife, who objects to his making a third matrimonial
venture, though she has apparently conceded the second.
In the same story a young woman&rsquo;s spook pursues one
Thomas, almost stamping on his heels, and finally vanishing
like a sky-rocket, leaving an odor of brimstone behind.
A specter rises from a well in <cite>The History of Jack Smith,
or the Castle of Saint Donats</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and shakes its hoary head
at a group of men who fire pistols at it.</p>

<p><cite>The Castle of Caithness</cite><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> shows a murdered father indicating
his wounds to his son and demanding vengeance.
An armored revenge ghost appears in <cite>Count Roderick&rsquo;s
Castle</cite>, or <cite>Gothic Times</cite>, an anonymous Philadelphia novel,
telling his son the manner of his murder, and scaring the
king, who has killed him, to madness. The revenge ghosts
in the Gothic do not cry &ldquo;Vindicta!&rdquo; as frequently as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the early drama, but they are as relentless in their hate.
In <cite>Ancient Records</cite>, or <cite>The Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswyth</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the spirit
of a nun who has been wronged and buried alive by the
wicked baron returns with silent, tormenting reproach.
She stands beside him at midnight, with her dead infant
on her breast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Suddenly the eyes of the specter become animated. Oh!&mdash;then
what flashes of appalling anger dart from their hollow
orbits on the horror-stricken Vortimer! Three dreadful
shrieks ring pealing through the chamber now filled with a
blaze of sulphurous light. The specter suddenly becomes
invisible and the baron falls senseless on his couch.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Scant wonder! In the same story Rosaline, the distressed
heroine, is about to wed against her will, when a specter
appears and forbids the bans. Again, Gondemar has a

&ldquo;lifts up his hollow, sunken countenance and beckons
with angry gestures for his departure.&rdquo; Gondemar
departs!</p>

<p>Another revenge ghost creates excitement in <cite>The Accusing
Spirit</cite>. A murdered marquis appears repeatedly to
interested parties and demands punishment on his
brother who has slain him. Another inconsiderate
specter in the same volume wakes a man from his sleep,
and beckoning him to follow, leads him to a subterranean
vault, stamps his foot on a certain stone, shows a ghastly
wound in his throat and vanishes. On investigation,
searchers find a corpse in a winding-sheet beneath the indicated
spot. Another accusing spirit appears in the same
story&mdash;that of Benedicta, a recreant nun, who glides as
a headless and mutilated figure through the cloisters and
hovers over the convent bed where she &ldquo;breathed out
her guilty soul.&rdquo; The young heroine who has taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
temporary refuge in the convent and has to share the
cell with this disturbing room-mate, is informed by an
old nun that, &ldquo;Those damned spirits who for mysterious
purposes receive permission to wander over the earth can
possess no power to injure us but that which they may
derive from the weakness of our imagination.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
the nervous girl insists on changing her room!
Another famous cloistered ghost, one of the pioneer
female apparitions of note, is the Bleeding Nun in Lewis&rsquo;s
<cite>The Monk</cite>, that hall of Gothic horrors. He provides an
understudy for her, who impersonates the nun in times
of emergency, providing complicating confusion for the
other characters and for the reader.</p>

<p>Ghosts begin to crowd upon each others&rsquo; heels in later
Gothic novels. No romance is so poor as not to have a
retinue of specters, or at least, a ghost-of-all-work. Emboldened
by their success as individuals, spooks appear in
groups and mobs. William Beckford in his <cite>Vathek</cite> presents
two thousand specters in one assembly. Beckford was no
niggard! In Maturin&rsquo;s <cite>The Albigenses</cite>, de Montfort, passing
alone through a dark forest, meets the phantoms of
countless victims of his religious persecution. Men, women,
young maidens, babes at the breast, all move toward him
with unspeakable reproach, with &ldquo;clattering bones, eyeless
sockets, bare and grinning jaws.&rdquo; Aside from Dante
the most impressive description of unhappy spirits in
a large number is given in <cite>Vathek</cite> in that immortal
picture of the Hall of Eblis. Beckford shows here a
concourse of doomed souls, each with his hand forever
pressed above his burning heart, each carrying his own
hell within him, having lost heaven&rsquo;s most precious boon,
the soul&rsquo;s hope! In the Hall of Eblis there are the still
living corpses, &ldquo;the fleshless forms of the pre-adamite
kings, who still possess enough life to be conscious of their
deplorable condition; they regard one another with looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the deepest dejection, each holding his right hand
motionless above his heart.&rdquo; The prophet Soliman is
there, from whose livid lips come tragic words of his sin
and punishment. Through his breast, transparent as
glass, the beholder can see his heart enveloped in flames.</p>

<p>In James Hogg&rsquo;s <cite>The Wool-Gatherer</cite>, a man of very evil
life is haunted by the wraiths of those he has wronged.
As he lies on his death-bed, not only he, but those around
him as well, hear the pleading voices of women, the pitiful
cries of babes around his bed, though nothing is visible.
We have here a suggestion of the invisible supernaturalism
that becomes so frequent and effective a motif in later
fiction. After the man is dead, the supernatural sounds
become so dreadful that &ldquo;the corpse sits up in the bed,
pawls wi&rsquo; its hands and stares round wi&rsquo; its dead face!&rdquo;
When the watchers leave the room for a few moments,
the body mysteriously disappears and is never found.
A somewhat similar instance occurs in one of Ambrose
Bierce&rsquo;s modern stories of dead bodies.</p>

<p>There is some attempt to exorcise restless spirits in a
number of Gothic novels. On various occasions the
priests come forth with bell, book, and candle to pronounce
anathema against the troublesome visitants. In
one story a monk crosses his legs to scare away the specter,
but forgets and presently tumbles over. In another,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
the priest peremptorily bids the ghosts depart and breaks
the news firmly to them that they cannot return for a
thousand years. But one bogle, whether of feeble understanding
or strong will, comes in to break up the ceremonies
of incantation, and scares the priest into hysterics.</p>

<p>The imagined ghost appears in many of the Gothic tales,
whose writers lack the courage of their supernaturalism.
Mrs. Radcliffe, for instance, loves to build up a tissue
of ghostly horrors, yet explains them away on natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
grounds after the reader fancies he sees a spirit around
every corner.</p>

<p>The ghosts that are deliberately got up for the purposes
of deception form an interesting feature of Gothic
methods. The reasons behind the spectral impersonations
are various, to frighten criminals into restitution
after confession, to further crime, or merely to enliven
the otherwise lagging story. In <cite>The Spirit of Turrettville</cite>
two youths follow the sounds of plaintive music
till, in a deserted, spookish apartment, they see a woman
playing at an old harp. As they draw near, they see only
skeleton hands on the keys and the apparition turns
toward them &ldquo;a grinning, mouldering skull.&rdquo; She waves
her hands with haughty rebuke for their intrusion and
&ldquo;stalks&rdquo; out of the oratory. She gives further performances,
however, singing a song composed for the
occasion. But the reader, after such thrills, resents
finding out later that she is the living wife, attempting to
frighten the villain into confession.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Accusing Spirit</cite> a bogus spook is constructed
by means of phosphorus, aided by a strong resemblance
between two men, to accuse an innocent man of murder.
The apparition dramatically makes his charge, but is
unmasked just in time to save the victim&rsquo;s life. A tall,
cadaverous young man makes up for a ghost in an
anonymous novel,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> while a mysterious woman in a black
veil attends a midnight funeral in the castle, then unaccountably
disappears.</p>

<p>In <cite>Melmoth</cite> the monks persecute a despised brother by
impersonating spirits in his cell. They cover the walls
with images of fiends, over which they smear phosphorus,
and burn sulphur to assist the deception. They utter
mocking cries as of demons, seeking to drive him mad.
In Lewis&rsquo;s <cite>Monk</cite> there is a false Bleeding Nun as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> specter. In other Gothic novels there are
various spectral frauds cleverly planned, and then revealed,
but their explanation does not altogether dispel
the uncanny impression they make.</p>

<p>The ghost that stays at home in a definite place, haunting
its own demesne, is a familiar figure in the fiction of
the period. Every castle has its haunted tower or
dungeon or apartment with its shade that walks by night.
Several appear carrying candles or lamps to light them
through the blackness of architectural labyrinths. Several
evince a fondness for bells and herald their coming by
rings. In one romance,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the ghost takes the form of a
white cow. (Doubtless many ghosts in real life have had a
similar origin.) In another,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a specter in armor appears to
terrify his murderer, and supernatural lightning aids in
his revenge.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to designate all the ghosts in
Gothic fiction for there is wholesale haunting. They
appear in the plot to warn, to comfort or command, and
seem to have very human characteristics on the whole.
Yet they are not so definitely personated, not so individual
and realistic as the spirits in later fiction, though
they do achieve some creepy effects. It is not their
brute force that impresses us. We are less moved by the
armored knight and the titanic adversary in Otranto
than by the phantoms in the Hall of Eblis. The vindictive
ghosts, mouldy from the vault, are less appalling
than the bodiless voices of wronged women and children
that haunt the death-bed and bring a corpse back to
dreadful life. The specters with flamboyant personality,
that oppress us with their egotistic clamor, may be soon
forgotten, but the ghostly suggestiveness of other spirits
has a haunting power that is inescapable. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Gothic ghosts have a strange vitality,&mdash;and, after all,
where would be the phantoms of to-day but for their
early services?</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">Witches and Warlocks.</h3> <p class="inline">While not at all equal in
importance to the ghosts, witches and warlocks add to the
excitement in Gothic fiction. There is but little change
from the witch of dramatic tradition, for we have both
the real and the reputed witch in the terror novel, the
genuine antique hag who has powers given her from the
devil, and the beautiful young girl who is wrongly suspected
of an unholy alliance with the dark spirits.</p>
</div>

<p>In <cite>Melmoth</cite>, there is an old woman doctor who has
uncanny ability. She tells fortunes, gives spells against
the evil eye and produces weird results &ldquo;by spells and
such dandy as is beyond our element.&rdquo; She turns the
mystic yarn to be dropped into the pit, on the brink
of which stands &ldquo;the shivering inquirer into futurity,
doubtful whether the answer to her question &lsquo;Who holds?&rsquo;
is to be uttered by the voice of a demon or lover.&rdquo; In
<cite>The Albigenses</cite> three Weird Sisters appear that are not
altogether poor imitations of Shakespeare&rsquo;s own. Matilda
in <cite>The Monk</cite> possesses dæmonic power of enchantment and
in the subterranean passages of the monastery she works
her unhallowed arts. The hag Carathis, in <cite>Vathek</cite>, is a
witch of rare skill, who concocts her magic potions and
by supernatural means forces all things to her will.
There are several witches and warlocks in James Hogg&rsquo;s
<cite>The Hunt of Eildon</cite>, who work much mischief but at last
are captured and convicted. They have the choice of
being burned alive or being baptized, but with wild
cries they struggle against the holy water and face the
flames.</p>

<p>In Hogg&rsquo;s <cite>Brownie of Bodbeck</cite>, Marion Linton believes
her own daughter is a witch and thinks she should be
given the trial by fire or water. There is an innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
young reputed witch in <cite>The Hunt of Eildon</cite>, who is
sentenced to death for her art.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">The Devil.</h3> <p class="inline">The devil incarnate is one of the familiar
figures in the terror novel. Here, as in the case of the
ghost, we see the influence of the dramatic rather than
of the epic tradition. He is akin to Calderon&rsquo;s wonder-working
magician and Marlowe&rsquo;s Dr. Faustus rather
than to the satanic creations of Dante and Milton. He is
not a dread, awe-inspiring figure either physically or as
a personality, though he does assume terrifying, almost
epic proportions in the closing scenes of <cite>The Monk</cite> and
<cite>Zofloya</cite>. Neither is he as human, as appealing to our
sympathies as the lonely, misjudged, misunderstood devils
in later fiction. We neither love nor greatly fear the
Gothic demon. Yet he does appear in interesting variants
and deserves our study.</p>
</div>

<p>In Hogg&rsquo;s <cite>Hunt of Eildon</cite> the devil comes in as a strange
old man who yet seems curiously familiar to the king and
to everyone who sees him, though no one can remember
just when he knew him. There is a clever psychologic
suggestiveness here, which perhaps inspired a similar
idea in a recent play, <cite>The Eternal Magdalen</cite>. Later he is
recognized and holy water thrown on him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The whole form and visage of the creature was changed in
a moment to that of a furious fiend. He uttered a yell that
made all the abbey shake to its foundations and forthwith
darted away into the air, wrapt in flames. As he ascended,
he waved his right hand and shook his fiery locks at his
inquisitors.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">There is nothing dubious about his personality here,
certainly!</p>

<p>Satan appears dramatically in <cite>The Monk</cite> as well. His
first visits are made in the form of attractive youth.
Ambrosio, who has been led into sin by the dæmonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
agent, Matilda, is awaiting death in the Inquisition cell,
when she comes to see him to urge that he win release by
selling his soul to the devil. But the repentant monk
refuses her advice, so she departs in a temper of blue
flame. Then he has a more dread visitant,&mdash;Lucifer
himself, described as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>His blasted limbs still bore the marks of the Almighty&rsquo;s
thunders; a swarthy darkness spread itself over his gigantic
form; his hands and feet were armed with long talons....
Over his huge shoulders waved two enormous sable wings;
and his hair was supplied by living snakes which twined
themselves with frightful hissings. In one hand he held a
roll of parchment, and in the other an iron pen. Still the
lightnings flashed around him and the thunder bursts seemed
to announce the dissolution of nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Ambrosio is overawed into selling his soul and signs the
compact with his blood, as per convention.</p>

<p>The devil doesn&rsquo;t keep to his agreement to release him,
however, for Lewis tells us that taking his victim to the top
of a mountain and &ldquo;darting his talons into the monk&rsquo;s
shaven crown, he sprang with him from the rock. The
caves and mountains rang with Ambrosio&rsquo;s shrieks. The
demon continued to soar aloft till, reaching a dreadful
height, he released the sufferer. Headlong fell the monk.&rdquo;
He plunges to the river&rsquo;s brink, after which a storm is
evoked by the devil and his body swept away in the flood.</p>

<p>A similar dæmonic manifestation occurs in <cite>Zofloya</cite>.
Victoria has been induced to bind herself to the Evil One,
who has appeared as a Moorish servant of impressive
personality and special powers. He grants her wishes
hostile to her enemies, holding many conferences with
her in the dark forest where he is heralded by flute-like
sounds. He appears sometimes like a flame, sometimes
like a lightning flash. He comes with the swiftness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
wind and tells her that her thoughts summoned him.
At last, he announces himself as Satan, and assumes his
own hideous form of gigantism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Behold me as I am, no longer that which I appeared to be,
but the sworn enemy of all created nature, by men called
Satan. Yes, it was I that under semblance of the Moor appeared
to thee.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he grasped more firmly the neck of Victoria,
with one push he whirled her headlong down the dreadful
abyss!&mdash;as she fell his loud dæmonic laugh, his yells of
triumph echoed in her ears; and a mangled corpse she fell,
she was received into the foaming waters below.</p>
</div>

<p>The devil is seen in <cite>Vathek</cite> as a preternaturally ugly
old man with strange powers. James Hogg has rather a
penchant for the demon, for he uses him in The <cite>Wool-Gatherer</cite>,
and in <cite>Confessions of a Justified Sinner</cite>, which is
a story of religious superstition, of the use of diablerie
and witchcraft, introducing a satanic tempter. On the
whole, the appearances of the devil in Gothic fiction lack
impressiveness, are weak in psychologic subtlety, and have
not the force either of the epic or of the dramatic representations.
Nor have they the human appeal that the
incarnations of the devil in later fiction make to our
sympathies.</p>

<p>In addition to the unholy powers possessed by the
devil and given by him to his agents, the witches, warlocks
and magicians, we see in Gothic fiction other
aspects of dæmonology, such as that associated with
animals and with inanimate objects. Supernaturalism
in the horror novel is by no means confined to human
beings, but extends to beasts as well. Animals are
supposed to be peculiarly sensitive to ghostly impressions,
more so than men, and the appearance of a specter is
often first announced by the extreme terror of some household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
pet, or other animal. Gothic dogs have very keen
noses for ghosts and howl lugubriously when an apparition
approaches. Ravens are represented as showing the
presence of evil powers, somewhat as the Southern darkey
believes that the jay-bird is the ally of the devil and
spends every Friday in torment. And one does not
forget the snaky coiffure that writhed around the demon&rsquo;s
head in <cite>The Monk</cite>.</p>

<p>Maturin&rsquo;s <cite>Albigenses</cite> introduces the story of a gruesome
loup-garou, or werewolf, which figures extensively in
folk-tales. In this case the husband of a beautiful young
woman is a werewolf who during his savage metamorphosis
tears her to pieces then disappears to return no
more. This is suggestive&mdash;with a less satisfactory ending&mdash;of
Marie de France&rsquo;s charming little <i lang="br" xml:lang="br">lai</i>, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Bisclavret</cite>.
Professor Kittridge has shown the frequency of the werewolf
motif in medieval story, by the variants he brings
together in his <cite>Arthur and Gorlogon</cite>. In <cite>The Albigenses</cite>
a lycanthrope also is described, a hideous human being
that fancies himself a mad wolf.</p>

<p>There is much use of animal supernaturalism in James
Hogg&rsquo;s romances. In one,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Sandy is saved from going
over a precipice by the warning of a hare that immediately
after vanishes, having left no tracks in the snow.
In another,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the two white beagles that the king uses in
hunting are in reality maidens bound by enchantment,
who are forced to slay human beings then transform them
into deer for the king and his company to eat. The other
dogs are aware of the unnatural state of affairs, while the
men are too stupid to realize it. The clownish Croudy is
changed into a hog, which brings amusing and almost
tragic complications into his life. His old dog knows him
and follows him pathetically, and a drove of cows go off
in a stampede at his approach, for they, too, sense the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
supernatural spell. Croudy is put on the block to be
killed for pork, when the fairy changes him back suddenly
to the consternation of the butcher. But Croudy does
not behave well after his transformation, so he is changed
into a cat with endless life. He may resume mortal shape
one night in the year and relate his feline experiences.</p>

<p>In the same story the king of Scotland is proposing a
toast when his favorite dog dashes the cup from his hand.
This is repeated several times, till the king learns that the
drink is poisoned, and the dog has thus by supernatural
knowledge saved his life. An innocent young girl, sentenced
to death for witchcraft because a fairy has taken
her form and worked enchantment, and her lover are
transformed into white birds that fly out of the prison the
night before the execution and live eternally on the shores
of a far lake.</p>

<p>The ghostly power extends to inanimate objects as well
as to human beings and animals. Armor and costumes
seem to have a material immortality of their own, for it
is quite common to recognize spectral visitants by their
garments or accouterments. Armor clanks audibly in the
terror scenes. In <cite>The Castle of Otranto</cite>, the giant ghost
sends his immense helmet crashing into the hall to
shatter the would-be-bridegroom and the hopes of his
father. The head-gear has power of voluntary motion and
moves around with agility, saves the heroine from danger
by waving its plumes at the villain and generally adds
excitement to the scenes. Later a titanic sword leaps
into place of itself, after having been borne to the entrance
by a hundred men fainting under the weight of it, while a
statue of Alfonso sheds three drops of blood from its nose
and a portrait turns round in its frame and strolls out into
the open.</p>

<p>Pictures in general take a lively part in horrific fiction.
The portrait of a murdered man in <cite>The Spirit of the Castle</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
picks itself up from the lumber heap where it has been
thrown, cleans itself and hangs itself back on the wall,
while<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> a portrait in a deserted chamber wags its head
at a servant who is making the bed. The portrait of
Melmoth is endowed with supernatural power, for its
eyes follow the beholder with awful meaning, and as the
nephew in desperation tears it from its frame and burns it,
the picture writhes in the flames, ironically, and mocks
him. This might be compared with Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s
<cite>Picture of Dorian Gray</cite> and with other later stories.</p>

<p>The statue of Alfonso in Walpole&rsquo;s <cite>Castle</cite> moves from
its place with no visible means of support, and<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> a great
effigy of black marble is said to &ldquo;march all round and
come back into its place again with a great groan.&rdquo;
In <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswyth</cite> the soil of the abbey grounds obtained by
gross injustice is haunted by the ghost of the wronged
nun who inflicts a curse upon it, rendering it &ldquo;spell-blighted,
unprolific, and impossible to till.&rdquo; The key to
the room in the old house in which Melmoth&rsquo;s diabolic
portrait is kept, turns in its lock with a sound like the
cry of the dead.</p>

<p>Gothic romance contains magic mirrors wherein one
can see any person he wishes no matter how distant he
may be, and watch his movements after the fashion of a
private moving-picture show,&mdash;such as that used by
Ambrosio.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> There are enchanted wands with power to
transform men to beasts or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>, as in <cite>The Hunt of
Eildon</cite>. There are crystal balls that reveal not only what
is going on in distant parts, but show the future as well.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The same volume describes magic swords that bear
changing hieroglyphics to be read only by enchantment
and other uncanny objects. These will serve to illustrate
the preternatural powers possessed by inanimate objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in the terror literature. In some instances the motif
is used with effectiveness, definitely heightening the
impression of the weird in a way that human supernaturalism
could not accomplish. We do not see here the mechanistic
supernaturalism, which is to become important in
later tales, and the effects here are crude, yet of interest
in themselves and as suggesting later uses of the idea.</p>

<p>Dæmonology manifests itself in the supernatural science
in the Gothic novels as well as in the characterization of
the devil and his confreres. We have diabolical chemistry
besides alchemy, astrology, hypnotism, ventriloquism,
search for the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, infernal biology, and
the other scientific twists of supernaturalism. In <cite>Vathek</cite>,
where we have a regular array of ghostliness, we see a
magic potion that instantly cures any disease however
deadly,&mdash;the progenitor of the modern patent medicine.
There is an Indian magician who writes his messages on
the high heavens themselves. Vathek&rsquo;s mother is an
industrious alchemist strangling an assembly of prominent
citizens in order to use their cadavers in her laboratory,
where she stews them up with serpent&rsquo;s oil, mummies, and
skulls, concocting therefrom a powerful potion. Vathek
has an uncurbed curiosity that leads him into various
experiments, to peer into the secrets of astrology, alchemy,
sorcery, and kindred sciences. He uses a magic drink
that gives the semblance of death, like that used later in
<cite>The Monk</cite>, as earlier, of course, in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Moor in <cite>Zofloya</cite> is well versed in dæmonic science.
He tells of chemical experiments where he forces everyone
to do his will or die. By his potions he can change
hate into love or love into hate, and can give a drug which
produces semi-insanity. Under the influence of this a man
weds a dæmonic temptress thinking her the woman he
loves, then commits suicide when he wakes to the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
This reminds us of Sax Rohmer&rsquo;s Fu-Manchu stories of
diabolic hypodermics that produce insanity.</p>

<p>In <cite>Ankerwich Castle</cite> a woman lying at the point of
death is miraculously cured by a drug whose prescription
the author neglects to state. In the same story a child
is branded in a peculiar fashion. A new-born babe
whose birth must remain secret yet who must be recognizable
in emergency, is marked on its side with letters
burnt in with a strange chemical, which will remain
invisible till rubbed with a certain liquid. Matilda in
<cite>The Monk</cite> dabbles in satanic chemistry and compounds
evil potions in her subterranean experiments.</p>

<p>Mary Shelley uses the idea of supernatural biology in
her story of the man-monster, <cite>Frankenstein</cite>, the story of
the young scientist who after morbid study and experiment,
constructs a human frame of supernatural size
and hideous grotesqueness and gives it life. But the thing
created appalls its creator by its dreadful visage, its more
than human size, its look of less than human intelligence,
and the student flees in horror from the sight of it. Mrs.
Shelley describes the emotions of the lonely, tragic thing
thrust suddenly into a world that ever recoils shuddering
from it. She reveals the slow hate distilled in its heart
because of the harsh treatment it meets, till at last it
takes diabolic revenge, not only on the man who has
created it but on all held dear by him. The struggles that
rend his soul between hate and remorse are impressive.
The wretched being weeps in an agony of grief as it stands
over the body of Frankenstein whom it has harried to
death, then goes away to its own doom. The last sight
of it, as the first, is effective, as, in tragic solitude, towering
on the ice-floe, it moves toward the desolate North to
its death.</p>

<p>In the characterization of this being, as in the unusual
conception, Mrs. Shelley has introduced something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
poignantly new in fiction. It was a startling theme for
the mind of a young girl, as were <cite>Vathek</cite> and <cite>The Monk</cite>
for youths of twenty years, and only the abnormal
psychological conditions she went through could have produced
it. There is more curdling awfulness in Frankenstein&rsquo;s
monster than in the museum of armored
ghosts, Bleeding Nuns, and accompanying horrors of the
early Gothic novels. The employment of the Frankenstein
motif in a play produced recently in New York,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
illustrates anew the vitality of the idea.</p>

<p>The search for the philosopher&rsquo;s stone appears in various
novels of the period. <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leon</cite>, by William Godwin,
relates the story of a man who knew how to produce
unlimited gold by a secret formula given him by a mysterious
stranger who dies in his home. Shelley<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> brings in this
power incidentally with the gift of endless life. There is
an awe-inspiring use of ventriloquism in Charles Brockden
Brown&rsquo;s novel, <cite>Wieland</cite>, while <cite>Arthur Mervyn</cite> gives
a study in somnambulism. <cite>Zofloya</cite> suggests hypnotism
or mesmerism by saying that Victoria&rsquo;s thought summoned
the Moor to her,&mdash;that they could have brought
him had he been &ldquo;at the further extremity of this terrestrial
globe.&rdquo; This seems a faint foreshadowing of Ibsen&rsquo;s
idea in The <cite>Master Builder</cite>. These may illustrate the use
of science in Gothicism.</p>

<p>The elixir of life is brewed in divers Gothic novels.
Dramatic and intense as are the psychological experiences
connected with the discovery of the magic potion, the
effects of the success are more poignant still. The thought
that endless mortality, life that may not be laid down,
becomes a burden intolerable has appeared in fiction
since Swift&rsquo;s account of the Struldbrugs, and perhaps
before. Godwin&rsquo;s <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leon</cite> is a story of the secret of
perpetual life. The tiresome Godwinistic hero is visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
by a decrepit old man who wishes to tell him on a pledge
of incommunicability what will give him the power of
endless life and boundless wealth. The impoverished
nobleman accepts with consequences less enjoyable than
he has anticipated.</p>

<p>Shelley&rsquo;s hectic romance,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> whose idea, as Shelley admitted
to Stockdale, came from Godwin&rsquo;s book, uses the
same theme. The young student with burning eyes, who
has discovered the elixir of life, may be compared with
Mary Shelley&rsquo;s later picture of Frankenstein. Events
are rather confused here, as the villain falls dead in the
presence of the devil but comes to life again as another
character later in the story,&mdash;Shelley informing us of
their identity but not troubling to explain it.</p>

<p>The most impressive instance of the theme of fleshly
immortality in the early novels is found in <cite>Melmoth</cite>.
Here the mysterious wanderer possesses the power of
endless life, but not the right to lay it down when existence
becomes a burden. Melmoth can win the boon of death
only if he can find another mortal willing to change destinies
with him at the price of his soul. He traverses
the world in his search and offers the exchange to persons
in direst need and suffering the extreme torments,
offering to give them wealth as well as life eternal. Yet
no man nor woman will buy life at the price of the
soul.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">Aids to Gothic Effect.</h3> <p class="inline">Certain themes appear recurringly
as first aids to terror fiction. Some of them are
found equally in later literature while others belong more
particularly to the Gothic. An interesting aspect of the
supernatural visitants is gigantism, or the superhuman
size which they assume. In <cite>The Castle of Otranto</cite>, the sensational
ghost is of enormous size, and his accouterments
are colossal. In the last scene he is astounding:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A clap of thunder shook the castle to its foundations; the
earth rocked and the clank of more than mortal armor was
heard behind.... The walls of the castle behind Manfred
were thrown down with a mighty force, and the form of
Alfonso, dilated to an immense magnitude, appeared in the
center of the ruins. &ldquo;Behold the true heir of Alfonso!&rdquo;
said the vision.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">This reminds one of an incident in F. Marion Crawford&rsquo;s
<cite>Mr. Isaacs</cite>, where the Indian magician expands to awful
size, miraculously draws down a mist and wraps it round
him as a cloak. Zofloya is frequently spoken of as immense,
and it is said that &ldquo;common objects seem to sink
in his presence.&rdquo; In the last scene the wicked Victoria
sees the Moor change from a handsome youth to a fierce
gigantic figure. A diabolic apparition eight or nine feet
high pursues a monk,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and the knight<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> engages in combat
with a dæmonic giant who slays him. The devil in <cite>The
Monk</cite> is represented as being of enormous stature, and
much of the horror excited by the man-monster that
Frankenstein created arises from the creature&rsquo;s superhuman
size. In most cases gigantism connotes evil power
and rouses a supernatural awe in the beholder. The giant is
an Oriental figure and appears in <cite>Vathek</cite>, along with genii,
dwarfs, and kindred personages, but the Gothic giant has
more diabolism than the mere Oriental original. He seems
to fade out from fiction, appearing only occasionally in
later stories, while he has practically no place in the drama,
owing doubtless to the difficulties of stage presentation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Insanity as contributing to the effect of supernaturalism
affords many gruesome studies in psychiatry. Madness
seems a special curse of the gods or torment from the devil
and various instances of its use occur in Gothic fiction.
The devil in <cite>Zofloya</cite>, at Victoria&rsquo;s request, gives Henrique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
an enchanted drug which renders him temporarily insane,
during which time he marries Victoria, imagining her to be
Lilla whom he loves. When he awakes to the realization
of what he has done, real madness drives him to suicide.
In <cite>The Castle of Caithness</cite> the wicked misanthrope goes
mad from remorse. He imagines that the different ones
he has murdered are hurling him into the pit of hell, until,
in a maniac frenzy, he dashes his brains out against the
prison walls. In <cite>Ethelwina</cite> the father who has sold his
daughter to dishonor flies shrieking in madness through the
corridors of the dungeon to escape the sight of his child&rsquo;s
accusing specter. Poor Nanny in Hogg&rsquo;s <cite>Brownie of
Bodbeck</cite> is described as having &ldquo;a beam of wild delight in
her eye, the joy of madness.&rdquo; She sings wild, unearthly
songs and talks deliriously of incomprehensible things, of
devilish struggles.</p>

<p>Melmoth uses the idea with special effectiveness. The
insanity of the young husband whose bride is mysteriously
slain on their wedding day by the supernatural power
accompanying Melmoth, may be compared with the madness
of the wife in Scott&rsquo;s <cite>Bride of Lammermoor</cite>. Maturin
also shows us a scene in a mad-house, where a sane man,
Stanton, is confined, whom Melmoth visits to offer exchange
of destinies. Melmoth taunts him cruelly with his
hopeless situation and prophecies that he, too, will go mad
from despair. We hear Stanton&rsquo;s wild cry, echoed by a
hundred yells like those of demons, but the others are stilled
when the mad mother begins her lamentation,&mdash;the
mother who has lost husband, home, children, reason, all,
in the great London fire. At her appalling shrieks all
other voices are hushed. Another impressive figure in the
mad-house is the preacher who thinks himself a demon and
alternately prays and blasphemes the Lord.</p>

<p>Charles Brockden Brown rivals Maturin in his terrible
use of insanity for supernatural effect. The demented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
murderer in <cite>Edgar Huntley</cite> gives an impression of mystery
and awe that is unusual, while <cite>Wieland</cite> with its religious
mania produced by diabolic ventriloquism is even more
impressive. Brown knew the effect of mystery and dread
on the human mind and by slow, cumulative suggestion
he makes us feel a creeping awe that the unwieldy machinery
of pure Gothicism never could achieve. In studies of
the morbid mentality he has few equals. For psychologic
subtlety, for haunting horror, what is a crashing helmet or
a dismembered ghost compared with Brown&rsquo;s Wieland?
What are the rackings of monkish vindictiveness when set
against the agonies of an unbalanced mind turned in upon
itself? What exterior torture could so appeal to our sympathies
as Wieland&rsquo;s despair, when, racked with religious
mania, he feels the overwhelming conviction that the
voice of God&mdash;which is but the fiendish trick of a ventriloquist&mdash;is
calling him to murder his wife and children as a
sacrifice to Deity? Such a tragedy of dethroned reason is
intolerably powerful; the dark labyrinths of insanity, the
gloom-haunted passages of the human mind, are more
terrible to traverse than the midnight windings of Gothic
dungeons. We feel that here is a man who is real, who is
human, and suffering the extremity of anguish.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most hideous aspect of insanity in the terror
novel is that of the lycanthrope in <cite>The Albigenses</cite>. The
tragic wolf-man imagines himself to be a mad wolf and
cowers in his lair, glaring with gleaming, awful eyes at all
who approach him, gnawing at a human head snatched
from the graveyard. There are various other uses of
insanity in the novel of the period, but these will serve to
illustrate. The relation between insanity and the supernatural
has been marked in later literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The use of portents is a distinct characteristic of the
horror romance. Calamity is generally preceded by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
sign of the supernatural influence at work, some presentment
of dread. Crime and catastrophe are forefelt by
premonition of woe and accompaniment of horror. In
<cite>The Accusing Spirit</cite> supernatural thunder heralds the
discovery of the corpse in its winding-sheet, and the monk
says, &ldquo;Yes, some dread discovery is at hand. These
phenomena are miraculous; when the common laws of
nature are violated, the awful portents are not sent in
vain.&rdquo; In <cite>The Romance of the Castle</cite>, an anonymous story,
a woman hears the clock strike two and announces that
she will be dead at three.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This night an awful messenger sent from that dread tribunal
from whose power there is no appeal, by signs terrific
foretold my fate approached&mdash;foretold my final moment.
&ldquo;Catherine, behold!&rdquo; was all that issued from the specter&rsquo;s
lips, but in its hand it held a scroll which fixed my irrevocable
doom, in letters which fascinated while they appalled my
sight.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">She keeps her appointment promptly. Her experience
might be compared with the vision which revealed his date
of death to Amos Judd in James Mitchell&rsquo;s novel of that
name, and to the foreknowledge in George Eliot&rsquo;s <cite>The
Lifted Veil</cite>.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Spirit of the Castle</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the ghost of the old marquis
knocks three times on the door preceding the arrival of the
heir, and a black raven flies away as he enters. At the
approach of the true heir to the estate from which he has
been kept by fraud in <cite>The Old English Baron</cite>, the doors of
the ancient castle fly open, upon which the servants cry,
&ldquo;The doors open of themselves to receive their master!&rdquo;
When Walpole&rsquo;s usurping Manfred sees the plumage on the
miraculous casque shaken in concert with the brazen
trumpet, he exclaims, &ldquo;What mean these portents? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
I have offended&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; At this point the plumes are
shaken still more strenuously, and the helmet is equally
agitated when the great sword leaps in. Manfred cries
to the apparition, &ldquo;If thou art a true knight, thou wilt
scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy power. If these
omens be from heaven or hell, Manfred trusts to righteousness
to protect his cause.&rdquo; But the omens bring bad luck
to Manfred.</p>

<p>There is much use of portent in <cite>Melmoth</cite>. The specter
of the Wanderer appearing just before the old man&rsquo;s death
predicts the spiritual doom of the dying. As the old uncle
is almost breathing his last, he cries out, &ldquo;What the devil
brings you here?&rdquo; at which the servants cross themselves
and cry, &ldquo;The devil in his mouth!&rdquo; Melmoth, the Wanderer,
is a walking portent of evil, for the priest is unable
to pray in his presence, the communion bread turns viperous
when he is there and the priest falls dead in the attempt
to exorcise the fiendish power. Mysterious strains of
music sound as heralds of disaster in several Gothic novels,
as<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> where the inexplicable strains are heard only by the
bride and groom preceding the strange tragedy that befalls
them.</p>

<p>At the approach of a supernatural visitant in the terror
novel the fire always burns blue,&mdash;where there is a fire,
and the great hearth usually affords ample opportunity for
such portentous blaze. The thermometer itself tends to
take a downward path when a ghost draws near. The
three drops of blood shed from the statue&rsquo;s nose in <cite>Otranto</cite>,
while ridiculed by the critics, are meant simply as a portent
of evil. Prof. William Lyon Phelps points out<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that the
idea did not originate with Walpole, but was familiar as
a superstition regarding premonition of ill, as referred to in
Dryden&rsquo;s <cite>Amboyna</cite>, <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>, 1. This instance may be compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with the much more skillfully handled omens in
later drama, as Maeterlinck&rsquo;s and Ibsen&rsquo;s, particularly in
<cite>The Emperor and Galilean</cite>. Various other portents of ill
appear in Gothic fiction.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The symbols of dread and the ghostly are used to good
effect in the terror romance. The cumulative effects of
supernatural awe are carefully built up by the use of gruesome
accompaniments and suggestions. The triple veil
of night, desolation, and silence usually hangs over the
haunter and the haunted, predisposing to an uncanny psychosis.
The Gothic ghost does not love the garish day,
and the terror castle, gloomy even under the brightest sun,
is of unimaginable darkness at night. Certain houses
add especially to the impression of fear. At crucial moments
the stroke of twelve or one o&rsquo;clock is sure to be
sounded appallingly by some abbey bell or castle clock or
other rusty horologue. In addition to its services as time-keeper,
the bell has a predisposition to toll.</p>

<p>Melancholy birds fly freely through these medieval tales,
their dark wings adding to the general gloom. The
principal specimens in the Gothic aviary are the common
owl, the screech or &ldquo;screeching&rdquo; owl, the bat and the
raven, while the flock is increased by anonymous &ldquo;birds
of prey,&rdquo; &ldquo;night birds,&rdquo; &ldquo;gloomy birds&rdquo; and so forth.
In <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswyth</cite>, as the murderer steals at midnight through
the corridor toward his helpless victim, &ldquo;the ill-boding bird
of night that sat screeching on the battlement of the prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
tower, whose harsh, discordant notes were echoed by the
hoarse croaking of the ominous raven&rdquo; terrifies but does
not deter the villain.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;moping, melancholy screech owl&rdquo; is one of the
prominent personages in <cite>The Accusing Spirit</cite>, emphasizing
the moments of special suspense, as in <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswyth</cite> as the
wicked baron lies quaking in remorse for having caused a
nun to be buried alive, the condemning cry of the doleful
birds increases his mental anguish. Similar instances,
with or without special nomenclature, occur in countless
Gothic novels. Much use is also made of the dark ivy
in its clambering over medieval architecture, shutting out
the light and adding to the general gloom. The effect
of horror is increased frequently by the location of the
scenes in vaults and graveyards with all their gruesome
accessories, and skulls are used as mural ornaments elsewhere,
or as library appointments by persons of morbid
temperament. Enough skeletons are exhumed to furnish
as large a pile of bones as may be seen in certain antique
churches in Italy and Mexico.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The element of mystery and mystification is another
family feature of the novel of suspense. There is no
proper thrill without the suspense attained by supernatural
mystery. Even the novels that in the end carefully
explain away all the ghostly phenomena on a natural basis
strive with care to build up plots which shall contain
astounding discoveries. Mrs. Radcliffe and Regina Maria
Roche are noted in this respect. They have not the
courage of their ghosts as such but, after they have thrilled
the reader to the desired extent, they tear down the fabric
of mystification that they have constructed and meticulously
explain everything.</p>

<p>The black veil constitutes a favorite method of suspense
with Mrs. Radcliffe. On various occasions Emily pales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and quivers before a dark velvet pall uncannily swaying
in the midnight wind, and on one such ramble she draws
aside the curtain and finds a hideous corpse, putrid and
dropping to decay, lying on a couch behind the pall.
Many chapters further on she learns that this is a wax
figure made to serve as penance for an ancient sinner.
Again she shivers in front of the inky curtain, watching its
fold move unaccountably, when a repulsive face peers out
at her. She shrieks and flees, thinking she has seen a
ghost, but discovers later that it is <em>only</em> one of a company
of bandits that have taken up their secret abode in the
house. Black veils are in fashion in all of Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s
romances and she drapes them very effectively, while the
arras waves likewise in other tales as well.</p>

<p>Mysterious manuscripts are another means of mystification.
Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s novels also abound in such scripts.
In <cite>The Romance of the Forest</cite> Adeline discovers a decaying
paper which reads, &ldquo;Oh, ye, whoever ye are, that chance
or misfortune may direct to this spot, to you I speak, to
you reveal the story of my wrongs and ask you to avenge
them.&rdquo; This injunction to avenge wrongs is a frequent
assignment, though rather much to ask in most cases.
<cite>The Spirit of the Castle</cite> has its dusty document that starts
off: &ldquo;Already my hand brandishes the dagger that shall
close my eyes forever. (Mysterious manuscripts are not
strong on grammar and make slight attempt to avoid
mixed figures.) I will expire by the side of the clay-cold
corpse of my Antoinette.&rdquo; In <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswyth</cite> the paper says,
&ldquo;Beneath the deep foundations of the ruin the recorded
mystery of the house of Oswyth lies buried from all mortal
discovery.&rdquo; But the most impressive manuscript is the
one in <cite>Melmoth</cite> that records the wanderings of the agonized
fate-harried man and those whose tortures he witnesses.
A codicil to the old uncle&rsquo;s will advises his nephew
against reading the document, but of course he does read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
it, since what are mouldy manuscripts in Gothic novels
for, but to be deciphered by the hero or heroine?</p>

<p>Reference to dread secrets occur otherwise than in
written form. In one favored tale,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> we are told of &ldquo;a
mystery whose elucidation I now have a presentiment
would fill me with horror!&rdquo; In another,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Vincent on his
death-bed speaks of &ldquo;a horrid secret which labors at my
breast,&rdquo; and the Abate speaks to the marquis of &ldquo;a secret
which shall make your blood run cold!&rdquo; In <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswyth</cite>
we hear that &ldquo;an impenetrable cloud of cureless sorrow
hung over Sir Alfred and there was a dreadful mystery in
his life destiny, unknown, as it should seem, to any one,
and which he was unwilling should be questioned.&rdquo; The
dungeoned prisoner in <cite>Bungay Castle</cite> cries, &ldquo;Were I at
liberty to speak I could a tale unfold would tempt you to
curse the world and even detest those claims which bind
man to man. You would be ready to forego the ties of
nature and shun society. Time must, it will develop the
whole of this mystery!&rdquo; And so on.</p>

<p>Inexplicable music forms one of the commonest elements
of mystification in these romances. Its constant recurrence
suggests that there must have been victrolas in
medieval times. The music is chiefly instrumental, sometimes
on a harp, sometimes on a violin, though occasionally
it is vocal. Mrs. Radcliffe and Regina Maria Roche
accompany the heroine&rsquo;s musings at all hours with doleful
strains suspected to be of supernatural performance.
The appearance of the devil masquerading as the Moor<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
is heralded by flute-like sounds, and in <cite>The Spirit of Turrettville</cite>
the specter plays on the harp and sings. The
recurrence of the theme is so constant that it acquires the
monotony of a tantalizing refrain.</p>

<p>Groans and wails of unexplained origin also aid in building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
up suspense. In fact, a chorus of lugubriousness arises
so that the Gothic pages groan as they are turned. Mysterious
disappearances likewise increase the tension.
Lights appear and vanish with alarming volition, doors
open and close with no visible human assistance, and various
other supernatural phenomena aid in Gothic mystery
and mystification.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although the ghosts and devils occupy the center of interest
in the horrific romance, the human characters must not
be lightly passed over. There are terror temperaments as
well as Gothic castles, tempests, and scenes. The interfering
father or other relative, brutal in threats and breathing
forth slaughter, comes in frequently to oppress the hero
or heroine into a loathed marriage. The hero is of Radcliffian
gloom, a person of vague past and saturnine temper,
admired and imitated by Byron. Sir Walter Raleigh,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
says, &ldquo;The man that Byron tried to be was the invention
of Mrs. Radcliffe.&rdquo; The officials of the Inquisition and the
dominant figures in convents and monasteries show fiendish
cruelty toward helpless inmates, gloating in Gothic
diabolism over their tortures. There are no restful human
shades of gray, only unrelieved black and white characters.
The Romantic heroine is a peculiar creature, much given
to swooning and weeping, yet always impeccably clad in
no matter what nocturnal emergency she is surprised.
She tumbles into verse and sketching on slight provocation,
but her worst vice is that of curiosity. In her search for
supernatural horrors she wanders at midnight through
apartments where she does not belong, breaks open boxes,
desks, and secret hiding-places to read whatever letters or
manuscripts she can lay her hands on, behaving generally
like the yellow journalist of fiction.</p>

<p>The pages of the Gothic novel are smeared with gore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and turn with ghostly flutter. The conversation is like
nothing on land or sea or in the waters under the earth, for
the tadpoles talk like Johnsonian whales and the reader
grows restless under Godwinistic disquisitions. The authors
are almost totally lacking in a sense of humor, yet
the Gothic novel, taken as a whole, is one of the best
specimens of unconscious humor known to English literature.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">Conclusion.</h3> <p class="inline">Perhaps the most valuable contribution
that the Gothic school made to English literature is Jane
Austen&rsquo;s inimitable satire of it, <cite>Northanger Abbey</cite>. Though
written as her first novel and sold in 1797, it did not appear
till after her death, in 1818. Its purpose is to ridicule the
Romanticists and the book in itself would justify the terroristic
school, but she was ahead of her times, so the editor
feared to publish it. In the meantime she wrote her
other satires on society and won immortality for her work
which might never have been begun save for her satiety of
medieval romances. The title of the story itself is imitative,
and the well-known materials are all present, yet how
differently employed! The setting is a Gothic abbey tempered
to modern comfort; the interfering father is not
vicious, merely ill-natured; the pursuing, repulsive lover
is not a villain, only a silly bore. The heroine has no
beauty, nor does she topple into sonnets nor snatch a
pencil to sketch the scene, for we are told that she has
no accomplishments. Yet she goes through palpitating
adventures mostly modelled on Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s incidents.
She is hampered in not being supplied with a
lover who is the unrecognized heir to vast estates, since
all the young men in the county are properly provided
with parents.</p>
</div>

<p>The delicious persiflage in which Jane Austen hits off
the fiction of the day may be illustrated by a bit of conversation
between two young girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. George Saintsbury<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> expresses himself as sceptical
of this list as a catalogue of actual romances, stating that
he has never read one of them and should like some other
authority than Miss Andrews for their existence. He is
mistaken in his doubt, however, since during the progress
of this investigation four out of the eight have been identified
as to authorship, and doubtless the others are lurking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in some antique library. <cite>Clermont</cite> is by Maria Regina
Roche; <cite>Mysterious Warnings</cite> by Mrs. Parsons, in London,
1796; <cite>Midnight Bell</cite> by Francis Latham; and <cite>Horrid
Mysteries</cite> by Marquis Grosse, London, 1796.</p>

<p>Jane Austen&rsquo;s stupid bore, John Thorpe, and Mr.
Tilney, the impeccable, pedantic hero, add their comment
to Gothic fiction, one saying with a yawn that there hasn&rsquo;t
been a decent novel since <cite>Tom Jones</cite>, except <cite>The Monk</cite>,
and the other that he read <cite>Udolpho</cite> in two days with his
hair standing on end all the time.</p>

<p>But the real cleverness of the work consists in the burlesque
of Gothic experiences that Catherine, because of
the excited condition of her mind induced by excess of
romantic fiction, goes through with on her visit to Northanger
Abbey. She explores secret wings in a search for
horrors, only to find sunny rooms, with no imprisoned wife,
not a single maniac, and never skeleton of tortured nun.
Mr. Tilney&rsquo;s ironic jests satirize all the elements of Gothic
romance. Opening a black chest at midnight, she finds
a yellowed manuscript, but just as she is about to read it
her candle flickers out. In the morning sunshine she
finds that it is an old laundry list. The only result of
her suspicious explorings is that she is caught in such
prowlings by the young man whose esteem she wishes to
win. He sarcastically assures her that his father is not
a wife-murderer, that his mother is not immured in a
dungeon, but died of a bilious attack. These delicately
tipped shafts of ridicule riddle the armor of medievalism
and give it at the same time a permanency of interest
because of Jane Austen&rsquo;s treatment of it. The Gothic
novel will be remembered, if for nothing else, for her
parody of it.</p>

<p>But Miss Austen is not the only satirist of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i>.
In <cite>The Heroine</cite>, Eaton Stannard Barrett gives an amusing
burlesque of it. It is interesting to note in this connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that while <cite>Northanger Abbey</cite> was written and sold in
1797 it was not published till 1818, and Barrett&rsquo;s book,
while written later, was published in 1813.</p>

<p>In the introduction, an epistle, supposed to be endited
by one Cherubina, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Moon</span>, May 1, 1813.
</p>

<p>Know that the moment that a mortal manuscript is written
in a legible hand and the word End or Finis attached thereto,
whatever characters happen to be sketched therein acquire
the quality of creating a soul or spirit which takes flight and
ascends immediately through the regions of the air till it
arrives at the moon, where it is embodied and becomes a
living creature, the precise counterpart of the literary prototype.</p>

<p>Know farther that all the towns, villages, rivers, hills, and
valleys of the moon also owe their origin to the descriptions
which writers give of the landscapes of the earth.</p>

<p>By means of a book, <cite>The Heroine</cite>, I became a living inhabitant
of the moon. I met with the Radclyffian and Rochian
heroines, and others, but they tossed their heads and told me
pertly that I was a slur on the sisterhood, and some went so
far as to say that I had a design on their lives.</p>
</div>

<p>Cherry, an unsophisticated country girl, becomes
Cherubina after reading romantic tales. She decides that
she is an heiress kept in unwarranted seclusion, and
tells her father that he cannot possibly be her father since
he is &ldquo;a fat, funny farmer.&rdquo; She rummages in his desk
for private papers, discovering a torn scrap that she
interprets to her desires. She flies, leaving a note to tell
the fleshy agriculturist that she is gone &ldquo;to wander over
the convex earth in search of her parents,&rdquo; with what
comic experiences one may imagine. There is much discussion
of the Gothic heroine, particularly those from Mrs.
Radcliffe&rsquo;s and Regina Maria Roche&rsquo;s pages. The girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sprinkles her letters with verse. She passes through storms,
explores deserted houses, and comes to what she thinks is
her ancestral castle in London, but is told that it is Covent
Garden Theatre. She decides that she is Nell Gwynne&rsquo;s
niece and goes to that amiable person to demand all her
property. She pokes around in the cellar to find her captive
mother, and discovers an enormously fat woman playing
with frogs, who drunkenly insists that she is her mother.
Leaving that place in disgust she takes possession of
somebody else&rsquo;s castle and orders it furnished in Gothic
style, according to romance. She has the fat farmer shut
up in the madhouse.</p>

<p>The book is very amusing, and a more pronounced
parody on Gothicism than <cite>Northanger Abbey</cite> because the
whole story turns round that theme,&mdash;but, of course, it is
not of so great literary value. It seems strange, however,
that it is so little known. It burlesques every feature of
terror fiction, the high-flown language, the excited oaths,
the feudal furniture, the medieval architecture, the Gothic
weather, the supernatural tempers, the spectral apparitions&mdash;one
of which is so muscular that he struggles with the
heroine as she locks him in a closet, after throwing rapee
into his face, which makes him sputter in a mortal fashion.
Cherubina finds a blade bone of mutton in some Gothic
garbage and takes it for a bone of an ancestor. Radcliffian
adjectives reel across the pages and the whole
plays up in a delightful parody the ludicrous weaknesses
and excesses of the terror fiction.</p>

<p>Likewise the Anti-Jacobin parodies the Gothic ghost and
there is considerable satire directed at the whole Gothic
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i> in Thomas Love Peacock&rsquo;s novel <cite>Nightmare Abbey</cite>.</p>

<p>In general, Gothicism had a tonic effect on English
literature, and influenced the continental fiction to no
small degree. By giving an interest and excitement
gained from ghostly themes to fiction, the terror writers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
made romance popular as it had never been before and
immensely extended the range of its readers. The novel
has never lost the hold on popular fancy that the Gothic
ghost gave to it. This interest has increased through the
various aspects of Romanticism since then and in every
period has found some form of supernaturalism on which to
feed. True, the machinery of Gothicism creaks audibly
at times, some of the specters move too mechanically, and
there is a general air of unreality that detracts from the
effect. The supernaturalism often lacks the naturalness
which is necessary. Yet it is not fair to apply to these
early efforts the same standards by which we judge the
novels of to-day. While their range is narrow they do
achieve certain impressive effects. Though the class
became conventionalized to an absurd degree and the
later examples are laughable, while a host of imitations
made the type ridiculous, the Gothic novel has an undeniable
force.</p>

<p>Besides the bringing of supernaturalism definitely into
fiction, which is a distinct gain, we find other benefits as
well. In Gothicism, if we examine closely, we find the beginnings
of many forms of supernaturalism that are crude
here, but that are to develop into special power in later
novels and short stories. The terror novel excites our
ridicule in some respects, yet, like other things that arouse a
certain measure of laughter, it has great value. It seems a
far cry from the perambulating statue in <cite>Otranto</cite> to Lord
Dunsany&rsquo;s jade gods that move with measured, stony steps
to wreak a terrible vengeance on mortals who have defied
them, but the connection may be clearly enough seen. The
dreadful experiments by which Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster is
created are close akin to the revolting vivisections of
Wells&rsquo;s Dr. Moreau, or the operations described by Arthur
Machen whereby human beings lose their souls and become
diabolized, given over utterly to unspeakable evil. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
psychic elements in <cite>Zofloya</cite> are crudely conceived, yet
suggestive of the psychic horrors of the work of Blackwood,
Barry Pain, and Theodore Dreiser, for example. The
animal supernaturalism only lightly touched on in Gothic
novels is to be elaborated in the stories of ghostly beasts
like those by Edith Wharton, Kipling, Ambrose Bierce,
and others. In fact, the greater number of the forms of
the supernatural found in later fiction and the drama are
discoverable, in germ at least, in Gothic romance. The
work of this period gave a tremendous impetus to the
uncanny elements of romanticism and the effect has been
seen in the fiction and drama and poetry since that time.
Its influence on the drama of its day may be seen in
Walpole&rsquo;s <cite>Mysterious Mother</cite> and Lewis&rsquo;s <cite>Castle Specter</cite>.
Thomas Lovell Beddoe&rsquo;s extraordinary tragedy, <cite>Death&rsquo;s
Jest Book</cite>, while largely Elizabethan in materials and
method, is closely related to the Gothic as well. It would
be impossible to understand or appreciate the supernatural
in the nineteenth-century literature and that of our own
day without a knowledge of the Gothic to which most of
it goes back. Like most beginnings, Gothicism is crude
in its earlier forms, and conventional in the flood of imitations
that followed the successful attempts. But it is
really vital and most of the ghostly fiction since that time
has lineally descended from it rather than from the supernaturalism
of the epic or of the drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="stl">Later Influences</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> Gothic period marked a change in the vehicle of
supernaturalism. In ancient times the ghostly
had been expressed in the epic or the drama, in
medievalism in the romances, metrical and prose, as in
Elizabethan literature the drama was the specific form.
But Gothicism brought it over frankly into the novel,
which was a new thing. That is noteworthy, since supernaturalism
seems more closely related to poetry than to
prose; and as the early dramas were for the most part
poetic, it did not require such a stretch of the imagination
to give credence to the unearthly. The ballad, the epic,
the drama, had made the ghostly seem credible. But
prose fiction is so much more materialistic that at first
thought supernaturalism seems antagonistic to it. That
this is not really the case is evidenced from the fact that
fiction since the terror times has retained the elements of
awe then introduced, has developed, and has greatly added
to them.</p>

<p>With the dying out of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i> definitely known as the
Gothic novel and the turning of Romanticism into various
new channels, we might expect to see the disappearance of
the ghostly element, since it had been overworked in
terrorism. It is true that the prevailing type of fiction
for the succeeding period was realism, but with a large
admixture of the supernormal or supernatural. The supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
machinery had become so well established in prose
fiction that even realists were moved by it, some using
the motifs with bantering apology&mdash;even Dickens and
Thackeray, some with rationalistic explanation, but practically
all using it. Man must and will have the supernatural
in his fiction. The very elements that one might
suppose would counteract it,&mdash;modern thought, invention,
science,&mdash;serve as feeders to its force. In the inexplicable
alchemy of literature almost everything turns to the unearthly
in some form or other.</p>

<p>We have seen the various sources from which the Gothic
novel drew its plots, its motifs for ghostly effect. The
supernatural fiction following it still had the same sources
on which to draw, and in addition had various other
influences and veins of literary inspiration not open to
Gothicism. Modern science, with the new miracles of its
laboratories, proved suggestive of countless plots; the new
study of folk-lore and the scholarly investigations in that
field unearthed an unguessed wealth of supernatural
material; Psychical Research societies with their patient
and sympathetic records of the forces of the unseen;
modern Spiritualism with its attempts to link this world
to the next; the wizardry of dreams studied scientifically,&mdash;all
suggested new themes, novel complications, hitherto
unknown elements continuing the supernatural in fiction.</p>

<p>With the extension of general reading, and the greater
range of translations from other languages, the writers of
England and America were affected by new influences
with respect to their use of the supernatural. Their work
became less insular, wider in its range of subject-matter
and of technical methods, and in our fiction we find the
effect of certain definite outside forces.</p>

<p>The overlapping influences of the Romantic movement
in England and America, France and Germany, form an
interesting but intricate study. It is difficult to point out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
marked points of contact, though the general effect may
be evident, for literary influences are usually very elusive.
It is easy to cry, &ldquo;Lo, here! lo, there!&rdquo; with reference to the
effect of certain writers on their contemporaries or successors,
but it is not always easy to put the finger on anything
very tangible. And even so, that would not explain
literature. If one could point with absolute certainty
to the source for every one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plots, would
that explain his art? Poe wrote an elaborate essay to
analyze his processes of composition for <cite>The Raven</cite>, but the
poem remains as enigmatic as ever.</p>

<p>As German Romanticism had been considerably affected
by the Gothic novel in England, it in turn showed an
influence on later English and American ghostly fiction.
Scott was much interested in the German literature treating
of evil magic, apparitions, castles in ruins, and so forth,
and one critic says of him that his dealings with subjects
of this kind are midway between Meinhold and Tieck.
He was fascinated with the German ballads of the supernatural,
especially Burger&rsquo;s ghostly <cite>Lenore</cite>, which he
translated among others. De Quincey likewise was a
student of German literature, though he was not so accurate
in his scholarship as Scott. His horror tale, <cite>The
Avengers</cite>, as well as <cite>Klosterheim</cite>, has a German setting and
tone.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion over the question of
Hawthorne&rsquo;s relation to German Romanticism. Poe
made the charge that Hawthorne drew his ideas and style
from Ludwig Tieck, saying in a criticism:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The fact is, he is not original in any sense. Those who
speak of him as original mean nothing more than that he
differs in his manner or tone, and in his choice of subjects,
from any author of their acquaintance&mdash;their acquaintance
not extending to the German Tieck, whose manner in <em>some</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of his works is absolutely identical with that <em>habitual</em> to Hawthorne....
The critic (unacquainted with Tieck) who reads
a single tale by Hawthorne may be justified in thinking him
original.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Various critics have discussed this matter with no very
definite conclusions. It should be remembered that Poe
was a famous plagiary-hunter, hence his comments may be
discounted. Yet Poe knew German, it is thought, and
in his writings often referred to German literature, while
Hawthorne, according to his journal, read it with difficulty
and spoke of his struggles with a volume of Tieck.</p>

<p>Hawthorne and Tieck do show certain similarities, as in
the use of the dream element, the employment of the
allegory as a medium for teaching moral truths, and the
choice of the legend as a literary form. Both use somewhat
the same dreamy supernaturalism, yet in style as in
subject-matter Hawthorne is much the superior and improved
whatever he may have borrowed from Tieck.
Hawthorne&rsquo;s vague mystery, cloudy symbolism, and deep
spiritualism are individual in their effect and give to his
supernaturalism an unearthly charm scarcely found elsewhere.
Hawthorne&rsquo;s theme in <cite>The Marble Faun</cite>, of the attaining
to a soul by human suffering, is akin to the idea in
Fouqué&rsquo;s <cite>Undine</cite>. There the supernaturalism is franker,
while that of Hawthorne&rsquo;s novel is more evasive and delicate,
yet the same suggestion is present in each case.
Lowell in his <cite>Fable for Critics</cite> speaks of Hawthorne as
&ldquo;a John Bunyan Fouqué, a Puritan Tieck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are still more striking similarities to be pointed
out between the work of Poe and that of E.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;A. Hoffmann.
As Hawthorne was, to a slight extent, at least,
affected by German legends and wonder tales, Poe was
influenced by Hoffmann&rsquo;s horror stories. Poe has been
called a Germanic dreamer, and various German and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
English critics mention the debt that he owes to Hoffmann.
Mr. Palmer Cobb<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> brings out some interesting facts in
connection with the two romanticists. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">The verification of Poe&rsquo;s indebtedness to German is to be
sought in the similarity of the treatment of the same motives
in the work of both authors. The most convincing evidence
is furnished by the way in which Poe has combined
the themes of mesmerism, metempsychosis, dual existence, the
dream element, and so forth, in exact agreement with the
grouping employed by Hoffmann. Notable examples of this
are the employment of the idea of double existence in conjunction
with the struggle of good and evil forces in the soul of the
individual, and the combination of mesmerism and metempsychosis
as leading motives in one and the same story.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Cobb points out in detail the similarities between
Poe&rsquo;s stories of dual personality and the German use of the
theme as found in Fouqué, Novalis, and Hoffmann, particularly
the last. Hoffmann&rsquo;s exaggerated use of this idea
is to be explained on the ground that he was obsessed by
the thought that his double was haunting him, and he,
like Maupassant under similar conditions of mind, wrote
of supernaturalism associated with madness. Hoffmann
uses the theme of double personality.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In Poe&rsquo;s <cite>William
Wilson</cite> the other self is the embodiment of good, a sort of
incarnate conscience, as in Stevenson&rsquo;s Markheim, while
Hoffmann&rsquo;s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Elixiere</cite> represents the evil. Poe has here
reversed the idea. In Hoffmann&rsquo;s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Magnetiseur</cite> we find
the treatment of hypnotism and metempsychosis and the
dream-supernaturalism in the same combination that Poe
uses.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Hoffmann<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and Poe<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> relate the story of a supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
portrait, where the wife-model dies as the sacrifice
to the painting.</p>

<p>Both Hoffmann and Poe use the grotesquerie of supernaturalism,
the fantastic element of horror that adds to
the effect of the ghostly. Even the generic titles are almost
identical.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But in spite of these similarities in theme and
in grouping, there is no basis for a charge that Poe owes
a stylistic debt to Hoffmann. In his manner he is original
and individual. He uses his themes with much greater
art, with more dramatic and powerful effect than his
German contemporary. Though he employs fewer of the
crude machineries of the supernatural, his ghostly tales
are more unearthly than Hoffmann&rsquo;s. His horrors have a
more awful effect because he is an incomparably greater
artist. He knows the economy of thrills as few have done.
His is the genius of compression, of suggestion. His dream
elements, for instance, though Hoffmann uses the dream
to as great extent as Poe&mdash;are more poignant, more unbearable.</p>

<p>The cult of horror in German literature, as evidenced in
the work of Hoffmann, Kleist, Tieck, Arnim, Fouqué,
Chamisso, had an influence on English and American
literature of supernaturalism in general. The grotesque
diablerie, the use of dream elements, magnetism, metempsychosis,
ghosts, the elixir of life&mdash;which theme appears
to have a literary elixir of life&mdash;are reflected to a certain
degree in the English ghostly tales of the generation following
the Gothic romance.</p>

<p>A French influence is likewise manifest in the later
English fiction. The Gothic novel had made itself felt in
France as well as in Germany, a proof of which is the fact
that Balzac was so impressed by Maturin&rsquo;s novel that he
wrote a sequel to it.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The interrelations of the English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
French, and German supernatural literature are nowhere
better illustrated than in the work of Balzac. He admits
Hoffmann&rsquo;s inspiration of his <cite>Elixir of Life</cite>, that horrible
story of reanimation, where the head is restored to life
and youth but the body remains that of an old man, dead
and decaying, from which the head tears itself loose in the
church and bites the abbot to the brain, shrieking out,
&ldquo;Idiot, tell me now if there is a God!&rdquo; Balzac&rsquo;s influence
over Bulwer-Lytton is seen in such stories as <cite>The Haunters
and the Haunted</cite>, <cite>or the House and the Brain</cite>, and <cite>A Strange
Story</cite>, in each of which the theme of supernaturally continued
life is used. Balzac&rsquo;s <cite>Magic Skin</cite> is a symbolic
story of supernaturalism that suggests Hawthorne&rsquo;s
allegoric symbolism and may have influenced it in part.
It is a new application of the old theme, used often in the
drama as in Gothic romance, of the pledge of a soul for
earthly gratification. A magic skin gives the man his
heart&rsquo;s desires, yet each granted wish makes the talisman
shrink perceptibly, with an inexorable decrease. This
theme, symbolic of the truth of life, is such a spiritual idea
used allegorically as Hawthorne chose frequently and
doubtless influenced Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <cite>Picture of Dorian Gray</cite>.
Balzac&rsquo;s <cite>Unknown Masterpiece</cite> is another example of his
supernaturalism that has had its suggestive effect on
English ghostly fictions.</p>

<p>Guy de Maupassant has doubtless influenced English
tales of horror more than any foreign writer since Hoffmann.
As a stylist he exercised a definite and strong influence
over the short-story form, condensing it, making it
more economical, more like a fatal bullet that goes straight
to the mark, and putting into a few hundred words a story
of supernatural horror relentless in its effect. O. Henry&rsquo;s
delicately perfect ghost story, <cite>The Furnished Room</cite>, is
reminiscent of Maupassant&rsquo;s technique as seen in <cite>The
Ghost</cite>. And surely F. Marion Crawford&rsquo;s <cite>Screaming Skull</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s <cite>Middle Toe of the Right Foot</cite> are
from the same body as Maupassant&rsquo;s <cite>Hand</cite>. What a
terrible corpus it must be! There is the same gruesome
mystery, the same implacable horror in each story of a
mutilated ghost.</p>

<p>Maupassant&rsquo;s stories of madness, akin to Poe&rsquo;s analyses
of mental decay, of the slow corruption of the brain, are
among his most dreadful triumphs of style, and have
influenced various English stories of insanity. In Maupassant&rsquo;s
own tottering reason we find the tragic explanation
of his constant return to this type of story. Such
tales as <cite>Mad</cite>, where a husband goes insane from doubt of
his wife; <cite>Madness</cite>, where a man has a weird power over
human beings, animals, and even inanimate objects, making
them do his will, so that he is terrified of his own self,
of what his horrible hands may do mechanically; <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cocotte</cite>,
where the drowned dog, following its master a hundred
miles down the river, drives him insane; <cite>The Tress</cite>, a
curdling story of the relation between insanity and the
supernatural, so that one is unable to say which is cause
and which effect, illustrate Maupassant&rsquo;s unusual association
between madness and uncanny fiction. Who
but Maupassant could make a story of ghastly hideousness
out of a parrot that swears? As Maupassant was influenced
by Poe, in both subject matter and technique, so
he has affected the English writers since his time in both
plot material and treatment of the supernatural. And
as his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Horla</cite> strongly reflects FitzJames O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s
<cite>What Was It? A Mystery</cite> that anticipated it by a number
of years, so it left its inevitable impress on Bierce&rsquo;s <cite>The
Damned Thing</cite> and succeeding stories of supernatural invisibility.
A recent story by Katherine Fullerton Gerould,
<cite>Louquier&rsquo;s Third Act</cite>, seems clearly to indicate the De
Maupassant influence, reflecting the method and motifs
of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Horla</cite> and <cite>The Coward</cite>. Maupassant&rsquo;s tales have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
peculiar horror possessed by few, partly because of his
undoubted genius and partly the result of his increasing
madness.</p>

<p>Other French writers have also influenced the uncanny
story in English. Théophile Gautier has undoubtedly
inspired various tales, such as <cite>The Mummy&rsquo;s Foot</cite>, by
Jessie Adelaide Weston, which is the match, though not
in beauty or form, to his little masterpiece of that title.
A. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s <cite>Lot No. 249</cite>, a horrible story of a reanimated
mummy, bears an unquestionable resemblance
to Gautier&rsquo;s <cite>The Romance of the Mummy</cite> as well as <cite>The
Mummy&rsquo;s Foot</cite>, though Poe&rsquo;s <cite>A Word with a Mummy</cite>, a
fantastic story emphasizing the science of miraculous
embalming of living persons so that they would wake to
life after thousands of years, preceded it. Something of
the same theme is also used by F. Marion Crawford,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
where the bodies in the old studio awake to menacing life.
This motif illustrates the prevalence of the Oriental
material in recent English fiction. Gautier&rsquo;s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Morte
Amoureuse</cite> has exercised suggestive power over later tales,
such as Crawford&rsquo;s vampire story,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> though it is significant
to recall that Poe&rsquo;s <cite>Berenice</cite> preceded Gautier&rsquo;s story by a
year, and the latter must have known Poe&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>The fiction of Erckmann-Chatrian appears to have suggested
various English stories. <cite>The Owl&rsquo;s Ear</cite> obviously
inspired another,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> both being records of supernatural
acoustics the latter dealing with spiritual sounds. <cite>The
Invisible Eye</cite>, a fearsome story of hypnotism, has an
evident parental claim on Algernon Blackwood&rsquo;s story,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
though the latter is psychically more gruesome. <cite>The
Waters of Death</cite>, an account of a loathsome, enchanted
crab, suggests H.&nbsp;G. Wells&rsquo;s story of the plant vampire.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Likewise Anatole France&rsquo;s <cite>Putois</cite>, the narrative of the
man who came to have an actual existence because someone
spoke of him as an imaginary person, is associated
with the drolleries of supernaturalism, such as are used
by Thomas Bailey Aldrich in the story of an imagined person,
<cite>Miss Mehitabel&rsquo;s Son</cite>, and by Frank R. Stockton.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Anatole France has several delicately wrought idylls of
the supernatural, as <cite>The Mass of Shadows</cite>, where the
ghosts of those who have sinned for love may meet
once a year to be reunited with their loved ones, and
in the church, with clasped hands, celebrate the spectral
mass, or such tender miracles as <cite>The Juggler of Notre
Dame</cite>, where the juggler throws his balls before the altar
as an act of worship and is rewarded by a sight of the
Virgin, or <cite>Scholasticus</cite>, a symbolic story much like one
written years earlier by Thomas Bailey Aldrich,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> where a
plant miraculously springs from the heart of a dead woman.
<cite>Amycus and Celestine</cite>, the story of the faun and the hermit,
of whom he tells us that &ldquo;the hermit is a faun borne down
by the years&rdquo; is suggestive of the wonderful little stories of
Lord Dunsany. Lord Dunsany, while startlingly original
in most respects, seems a bit influenced by Anatole France.
His <cite>When the Gods Slept</cite> seems reminiscent of <cite>The Isle
of the Penguins</cite>. In France&rsquo;s satire the gods change penguins
into men whose souls will be lost, because the priest
has baptized them by mistake, while in Dunsany&rsquo;s story
the baboons pray to the Yogis, who promise to make them
men in return for their devotion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>And the baboons arose from worshipping, smoother about
the face and a little shorter in the arms, and went away and
hid themselves in clothing and herded with men. And men
could not discern what they were for their bodies were bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of men though their souls were still the souls of beasts and
the worship went to the Yogis, spirits of ill.</p>
</div>

<p>Maeterlinck, influenced by his fellow-Belgian, Charles
Van Lerberghe, whose <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Flaireurs</cite> appeared before Maeterlinck&rsquo;s
plays of the uncanny and to whom he acknowledges
his indebtedness, has strongly affected ghostly literature
since his rise to recognition. In his plays we find an atmospheric
supernaturalism. The settings are of earth,
yet with an unearthly strangeness, with no impression of
realism, of the familiar, the known. In Maeterlinck&rsquo;s
plays we never breathe the air of actuality, never feel the
footing of solid earth, as we always do in Shakespeare,
even in the presence of ghosts or witches. Shakespeare&rsquo;s
visitants are ghostly enough, certainly, but the scenes in
which they appear are real, are normal, while in the Belgian&rsquo;s
work there is a fluidic supernaturalism that transforms
everything to unreality. We feel the grip of fate,
as in the ancient Greek tragedies, the inescapable calamity
that approaches with swift, silent pace. Yet Maeterlinck&rsquo;s
is essentially static drama. There is very little
action, among the human beings, at least, for Fate is the
active agent. In <cite>The Blind</cite>, <cite>The Intruder</cite>, and <cite>Interior</cite> the
elements are much the same, the effects wrought out with
the same unearthly manner. But in <cite>Joyzelle</cite>, which shows
a certain similarity to <cite>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</cite> and <cite>The
Tempest</cite>, we have a different type of supernaturalism, the
use of enchantment, of fairy magic that comes to a close
happily. In the dream-drama<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> there is a mixture of
realism and poetic symbolism, the use of the dream as a
vehicle for the supernormal, and many aspects of the weird
combined in a fairy play of exquisite symbolism.</p>

<p>The influence of Maeterlinck is apparent in the work of
English writers, particularly of the Celtic school. W.&nbsp;B.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Yeats&rsquo;s fairy play, <cite>The Land of Heart&rsquo;s Desire</cite>, with its
pathetic beauty, <cite>Countess Cathleen</cite>, his tragedy of the
countess who sells her soul to the devil that her people
may be freed from his power, as well as his stories, show
the traces of Maeterlinck&rsquo;s methods. William Sharp, in
his sketches and his brief plays in the volume called <cite>Vistas</cite>,
reflects the Belgian&rsquo;s technique slightly, though with his
own individual power. Sharp&rsquo;s other literary self, Fiona
McLeod, likewise shows his influence, as does Synge in
his <cite>Riders to the Sea</cite>, and Gordon Bottomley in his
<cite>Crier by Night</cite>, that eerie tragedy of an unseen power.
Maeterlinck&rsquo;s supernaturalism seems to suggest the poetry
of Coleridge, with its elusive, intangible ghostliness. The
effect of naïveté observable in Coleridge&rsquo;s work is in
Maeterlinck produced by a child-like simplicity of style,
a monosyllabic dialogue, and a monotonous, unreasoning
repetition that is at once real and unreal. The dramatist
has brought over from the poet the same suggestive use of
portents and symbols for prefiguring death or disaster that
lurks just outside. The ghostliness is subtle, rather than
evident, the drama static rather than dynamic.</p>

<p>Ibsen, also, has strongly influenced the supernatural in
both our drama and our fiction. His own work has a
certain kinship with that of Hawthorne, showing a like
symbolism and mysticism, a like transfusion of the unreal
with the natural, so that one scarcely knows just how far
he means our acceptance of the unearthly to extend. He
leaves it in some cases an open question, while in others he
frankly introduces the supernatural. The child&rsquo;s vision
of the dead heroes riding to Valhalla, with his own mother
who has killed herself, leading them,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the ghost that tries to
make an unholy pact with the king,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the apparition and the
supernatural voice crying out &ldquo;He is the God of Love!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
illustrate Ibsen&rsquo;s earlier methods. The curious, almost
inexplicable <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>, with its mixture of folk-lore and
symbolism, its ironic laughter and satiric seriousness,
seems to have had a suggestive influence on other works,
such as <cite>Countess Eve</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> where the personification of temptation
in the form of committed sin reflects Ibsen&rsquo;s idea of
Peer Gynt&rsquo;s imaginary children. The uncanny power of
unspoken thought, the haunting force of ideas rather than
the crude visible phantasms of the dead, as in the telepathy,
or hypnotism, or what you will, in <cite>The Master
Builder</cite>, the evasive, intangible haunting of the living by
the dead as in <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>, the strange powers at work
as in <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>, have had effect on the numerous
psychic dramas and stories in English. The symbolic
mysticism in <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite>, showing the
spirits of Cain and of Judas, with their sad ignorance of
life&rsquo;s riddles, the vision of Christ in person, with His unceasing
power over men&rsquo;s souls, foreshadowed the plays
and stories bringing in the personality of Christ, as <cite>The
Servant in the House</cite>, and <cite>The Passing of the Third Floor
Back</cite>.</p>

<p>Modern Italian literature, as represented by Fogazzaro
and D&rsquo;Annunzio, introduces the ghostly in fiction and
in the drama, and has had its effect on our literature.
Fogazzaro&rsquo;s novels are essentially realistic in pattern, yet
he uses the supernatural in them, as in miraculous visions,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
and metempsychosis and madness associated with the
supernatural.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> D&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s handling of the unearthly
is more repulsive, more psychically gruesome, as the
malignant power of the ancient curse in <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Città Morta</cite>,
where the undying evil in an old tomb causes such
revolting horror in the action of the play. This has a counterpart
in a story,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> by Josephine Daskam Bacon, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
packet of letters from two evil lovers lie buried in a hearth
and by their subtle influence corrupt the soul of every
woman who occupies the room. D&rsquo;Annunzio uses the witch
motive powerfully,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> madness that borders on the supernatural,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
and the idea of evil magic exorcised by melting
an image of wax to cause an enemy&rsquo;s death<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> which suggests
Rossetti&rsquo;s poem using that incident, the unforgettable
<cite>Sister Helen</cite>.</p>

<p>Likewise a new force in the work of the Russian school
has affected our fiction of the ghostly in recent years.
Russian literature is a new field of thought for English
people, since it is only of late years that translations have
been easily accessible, and, because of the extreme difficulty
of the language, very few outsiders read Russian.
As German Romanticism began to have its definite power
over English supernatural fiction in the early part of the
nineteenth century by the extension of interest in and
study of German literature, and the more frequent translation
of German works, so in this generation Russian
literature has been introduced to English people and is
having its influence.</p>

<p>A primitive, still savage race like the Russians naturally
shows a special fondness for the supernatural. Despite
the fact that literature is written for the higher classes, a
large peasant body, illiterate and superstitious, will influence
the national fiction. In the Russian works best
known to us there is a large element of the uncanny, of
a type in some respects different from that of any other
country. Like the Russian national character, it is harsh,
brutal, violent, yet sentimental. One singular thing to
be noted about it is the peculiar combination of supernaturalism
with absolute realism. The revolting yet dreadfully
effective realism of the Russian literature is never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
more impressive than in its union with ghostly horror,
which makes the impossible appear indubitable. In
Gogol&rsquo;s <cite>The Cloak</cite>, for instance, the fidelity to homely details
of life, the descriptions of pinching poverty, of tragic
hopes that waited so long for fulfillment, are painful in
themselves and give verisimilitude to the element of the
unearthly that follows. You feel that a poor Russian clerk
who had stinted himself from necessity all his life <em>would</em>
come back from the dead to claim his stolen property and
demand redress. The supernatural gains a new power, a
more tremendous thrill when set off against the every-dayness
of sordid life. We find something of the same effect
in the stories of Algernon Blackwood and Ambrose Bierce
and F. Marion Crawford.</p>

<p>Tolstoi&rsquo;s symbolic story of <cite>Ivan the Fool</cite> is an impressive
utterance of his views of life, expressed by the allegory of
man&rsquo;s folly and wisdom and the schemes of devils.</p>

<p>Turgeniev&rsquo;s pronounced strain of the unearthly has had
its influence on English fiction. He uses the dream elements
to a marked degree, as in <cite>The Song of Love Triumphant</cite>,
a story of Oriental magic employed through
dreams and music, and <cite>The Dream</cite>, an account of a
son&rsquo;s revelatory visions of his unknown father. The
dream element has been used considerably in our late
fiction, some of which seems to reflect Turgeniev. Another
motive that he uses effectively is that of suggested vampirism,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and of psychical vampirism,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> where a young man is
&ldquo;set upon&rdquo; by the spirit of a dead woman he has scarcely
known, till he dies under the torment. This seems to have
affected such stories as that of psychical vampirism in <cite>The
Vampire</cite>, by Reginald Hodder. We find in much of
Turgeniev&rsquo;s prose the symbolic, mystical supernaturalism
besides his use of dreams, visions, and a distinct Oriental
element. In <cite>Knock! Knock! Knock!</cite> the treatment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
whose spiritualism reminds one somewhat of Browning&rsquo;s,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
in its initial skepticism and later hesitation, the final effect
of which is to impress one with a sense of supernaturalism
working extraordinarily through natural means, so that it
is more powerful than the mere conventional ghostly
could be, we see what may have been the inspiration for
certain spiritualistic novels and stories in English. The
same tone is felt in Hamlin Garland&rsquo;s treatment of the
subject, for instance. The mystical romanticism of
Turgeniev is less brutally Russian than that of most
of his compeers.</p>

<p>Like Maupassant and Hoffman and Poe, the Russian
writers use to a considerable extent the association between
insanity and the supernatural to heighten the
effect of both. They may have been influenced in this
by Poe&rsquo;s studies of madness, as by Maupassant&rsquo;s, and they
appear to have an influence over certain present-day
writers. It would be difficult to say which is the stronger
influence in the treatment of abnormal persons, Maupassant
or the Russian writers. One wonders what type of
mania obsesses certain of the Russian fictionists of to-day,
for surely they cannot be normal persons. Examples of
such fiction are: Alexander Pushkin&rsquo;s story of mocking
madness resulting from a passion for cards, whose ghostly
motif has a sardonic diabolism,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Tchekhoff&rsquo;s story of
abnormal horror,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a racking account of insanity,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and
<cite>The Black Monk</cite>, a weird story of insanity brought on by
the vision of a supernatural being, a replicated mirage of
a black monk a thousand years old. But it is in the work
of Leonidas Andreyev that we get the ultimate anguish of
madness. <cite>The Red Laugh</cite>, an analysis of the madness
of war, of the insanity of nations as of individuals, seems
to envelop the world in a sheet of flame. Its horrors go beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
words and the brain reels in reading. There are in
English a number of stories of insanity associated with the
supernatural which may have been influenced by the
Russian method, though Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s studies in the
abnormality of soldier life preceded Andreyev by years.
F. Marion Crawford&rsquo;s <cite>The Dead Smile</cite> and various stories
of Arthur Machen have a Russian horror, and other
instances might be mentioned.</p>

<p>The Russian fiction with its impersonality of pessimism,
its racial gloom, its terrible sordid realism forming a basis
for awesome supernaturalism, is of a type foreign to our
thought, yet, as is not infrequently the case, the radically
different has a strange appeal, and the effect of it on our
stories of horror is undoubted. English and American
readers are greatly interested in Russian literature just
now and find a peculiar relish in its terrors, though the
harsher elements are somewhat softened in transference
to our language.</p>

<p>Other fields of thought have been opened to us within
this generation by the widening of our knowledge of
the literature of other European countries. Books are
much more freely translated now than formerly and no
person need be ignorant of the fiction of other lands.
From the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Chinese, Japanese,
and other tongues we are receiving stories of supernaturalism
that give us new ideas, new points of view. The
greater ease of travel, the opportunity to study once-distant
lands and literatures have been reflected in our
fiction. Some one should write a monograph on the
literary influence of Cook&rsquo;s tours! Our later work has
a strong touch of the Oriental,&mdash;not an entirely new
thing, since we find it in Beckford&rsquo;s <cite>Vathek</cite> and the pre-Gothic
tales of John Hawkesworth,&mdash;but more noticeable
now. Examples are Stevenson&rsquo;s <cite>New Arabian Nights</cite>,
<cite>Bottle Imp</cite>, and others, F. Marion Crawford&rsquo;s <cite>Khaled</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and <cite>Mr. Isaacs</cite>, Blackwood&rsquo;s stories of Elementals,
George Meredith&rsquo;s fantasy, <cite>The Shaving of Shagpat</cite>,
though many others might be named. The Oriental
fiction permits the use of magic, sorcery, and various elements
that seem out of place in ordinary fiction. The
popularity of Kipling&rsquo;s tales of Indian native life and
character illustrates our fondness for this aspect of supernaturalism.</p>

<p>Apart from the foreign influences that affect it we notice
a certain change in the materials and methods of ghostly
fiction in English. New elements had entered into
Gothic tales as an advance over the earlier forms, yet conventions
had grown up so that even such evasive and elusive
personalities as ghosts were hidebound by precedent.
While the decline of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i> definitely known as the
Gothic novel in no sense put an end to the supernatural
in English fiction, it did mark a difference in manner.
The Gothic ghosts were more elementary in their nature,
more superficial, than those of later times. Life was,
in the days of Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe, more local
because of the limitations of travel and communication,
it being considered astounding in Gothic times that a ghost
could travel a thousand miles with ease while mortals
moved snail-like. Scientific investigation was crude compared
with the present and had not greatly touched
fiction. Scientific folk-lore investigations were as unknown
as societies of psychical research, hence neither
had aided in the writing of ghostly fiction.</p>

<p>The mass of ghostly stuff which has appeared in English
since the Gothic period, and which will be classified and
discussed under different motifs in succeeding chapters,
shows many of the same characteristics of the earlier,
yet exhibits also a decided development over primitive,
classical and Gothic forms. The modern supernaturalism
is more complex, more psychological than the terroristic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
perhaps because nowadays man is more intellectual, his
thought-processes more subtle. Humanity still wants
ghosts, as ever, but they must be more cleverly presented
to be convincing. The ghostly thrill is as ardently desired
by the reading public, as eagerly striven for by the
writers as ever, though it is more difficult of achievement
now than formerly. Yet when it is attained it is more
poignant and lasting in its effects because more subtle in
its art. The apparition that eludes analysis haunts the
memory more than do the comparatively simple forms of
the past. Compare, for instance, the spirits evoked by
Henry James and Katherine Fullerton Gerould with the
crude clap-trap of cloistered spooks and armored knights
of Gothic times. How cheap and melodramatic the
earlier attempts seem!</p>

<p>The present-day ghost is at once less terrible and more
terrible than those of the past. There is not so much a
sense of physical fear now, as of psychic horror. The
pallid specters that glide through antique castles are
ineffectual compared with the maleficent psychic invasions
of modernity. On the other hand, the recent ghostly
story frequently shows a strong sense of humor unknown
in Gothicism, and only suggested in earlier forms, as in
the elder Pliny&rsquo;s statement that ghosts would not visit a
person afflicted with freckles, which shows at least a
germinal joviality in classical spooks.</p>

<p>One feature that distinguishes the uncanny tales of
to-day from the Gothic is their greater range of material.
The early terror story had its source in popular superstition,
classical literature, medieval legends, or the
Elizabethan drama, while in the century that has elapsed
since the decay of the Gothic novel as such, new fields of
thought have been opened up, and new sources for ghostly
plots have been discovered which the writers of modern
stories are quick to utilize. Present-day science with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wonderful development has provided countless plots for
supernatural stories. Comparative study of folk-lore,
with the activities of the numerous associations, has
brought to light fascinating material. Modern Spiritualism,
with its seances, its mediumistic experiments, has
inspired many novels and stories. The Psychical Research
Society, with branches in various parts of the
world and its earnest advocates and serious investigations,
has collected suggestive stuff for many ghostly stories.
The different sources for plot material and mechanics
for awesome effect, added to these from which the terror
novel drew its inspiration, have incalculably enriched
the supernatural fiction and widened the limits far beyond
the restrictions of the conventionalized Gothic.</p>

<p>Science has furnished themes for many modern stories
of the supernatural. Modern science itself, under normal
conditions, seems like necromancer&rsquo;s magic, so its incursion
into thrilling fiction is but natural. Every aspect
of research and discovery has had its exponent in fictive
form, and the skill with which the material is handled
constitutes one point of difference between the present
ghostly stories and the crude scientific supernaturalism
of the early novels. The influence of Darwin, Spencer,
Huxley, and other scientists of the last century did much
to quicken fiction as well as thought, and the effects can
be traced in the work of various authors.</p>

<p>The widespread interest in folk-lore in recent years
has had an appreciable influence on the stories of the
supernatural. While the methods of investigation followed
by the serious students of folk-lore are scientific
and the results are tabulated in an analytic rather than a
literary style, yet the effect is helpful to fiction. Comparative
studies in folk-lore, by the bringing together of a
mass of material from diverse sources, establishes the fact
of the universal acceptance of supernaturalism in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
form. Ethnic superstitions vary, yet there is enough
similarity between the ideas held by tribes and races so
widely separated as to discredit any basis of imitation or
conscious influence between them, to be of great interest
to scientists. No tribe, however low in the social scale,
has been found that has no belief in powers beyond the
mortal.</p>

<p>Folk-lore associations are multiplying and the students
of literature and anthropology are joining forces in the
effort to discover and classify the variant superstitions
and legends of the past and of the races and tribes still in
their childhood. Such activities are bringing to light a
fascinating wealth of material from which the writers of
ghostly tales may find countless plots. Such studies
show how close akin the world is after all. A large
number of books relating stories of brownies, bogles,
fairies, banshees, wraiths, hobgoblins, witches, vampires,
ghouls, and other superhuman personages have appeared.
I am not including in this list the fairy stories that are
written for juvenile consumption, but merely the folk-loristic
or literary versions for adults.</p>

<p>The most marked instance of the influence of folk-lore
in supplying subject matter for literature is shown in the
recent Celtic revival. The supernatural elements in the
folk-tales of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have been
widely used in fiction, poetry, and the drama. In this
connection one is reminded of Collins&rsquo;s <cite>Ode on the Popular
Superstitions of the Highlands Considered as the Subject
for Poetry</cite>. The Irish National School, with W.&nbsp;B. Yeats,
John Synge, and Lady Gregory as leaders, have made the
folk-tales of Ireland live in literature and the ghostly
thrill of the old legends comes down to us undiminished.
Lord Dunsany&rsquo;s work is particularly brilliant, going back
to ancient times and re-creating the mythologic beings for
us, making us friendly with the gods, the centaurs, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
giants, and divers other long-forgotten characters. Kipling
has made the lore of the Indian towns and jungles live for
us, as Joel Chandler Harris has immortalized the legends
of the southern negro. Thomas A. Janvier in his tales
of old Mexico calls back the ghosts of Spanish conquerors
and Aztec men and women, repeopling the ancient streets
with courtly specters. The fondness for folk-loristic
fiction is one of the marked aspects of Romanticism at
the present time.</p>

<p>The activities of the Society for Psychical Research
have had decided effect in stimulating ghostly stories.
When so many intelligent persons turn their attention
to finding and classifying supernatural phenomena the
currents of thought thus set up will naturally influence
fiction. Nowadays every interest known to man is
reflected in literature. The proceedings of the association
have been so widely advertised and so open to the
public that persons who would not otherwise give thought
to the supernatural have considered the matter. Such
thinkers as W.&nbsp;T. Stead and Sir Oliver Lodge, to mention
only two, would inevitably influence others. In this
connection it is interesting to note the recent claims by
Stead&rsquo;s daughter that her father has communicated
with the living, and Lodge&rsquo;s book, just published, <cite>Raymond,
or Life and Death</cite>, that gives proof of what he
considers incontrovertible messages from his son killed
in battle. The collection of thousands of affirmative
answers to the question as to whether one had ever felt a
ghostly presence not to be explained on natural grounds
brought out a mass of material that might serve for
plot-making. Haunted houses have been catalogued
and the census of specters taken.</p>

<p>The investigations in modern Spiritualism have done
much to affect ghostly literature. The terrors of the
later apparitions are not physical, but psychical, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
probably the stories of the future will be more and more
allied to Spiritualism. Hamlin Garland, John Corbin,
William Dean Howells, Algernon Blackwood, Arnold
Bennett, and others have written novels and stories of this
material, though scarcely the fringe of the garment of
possibilities has yet been touched. If one but grant the
hypothesis of Spiritualism, what vistas open up for the
novelist! What thrilling complications might come from
the skillful manipulation of astrals alone,&mdash;as aids in
establishing alibis, for instance! Even the limitations
that at present bind ghost stories would be abolished and
the effects of the dramatic employment of spiritualistic
faith would be highly sensational. If the will be all
powerful, then not only tables but mountains may be
moved. The laws of physics would be as nothing in the
presence of such powers. A lovelorn youth bent on
attaining the object of his desires could, by merely willing
it so, sink ocean liners, demolish skyscrapers, call up
tempests, and rival German secret agents in his havoc.
Intensely dramatic psychological material might be
produced by the conflict resulting from the double or
multiple personalities in one&rsquo;s own nature, according to
spiritualistic ideas. There might be complicated crossings
in love, wherein one would be jealous of his alter ego, and
conflicting ambitions of exciting character. The struggle
necessary for the model story might be intensely dramatic
though altogether internal, between one&rsquo;s own selves.
One finds himself so much more interesting in the light
of such research than one has ever dreamed. The distinctions
between materializations and astralizations,
etherealizations and plain apparitions might furnish good
plot structure. The personality of the &ldquo;sensitives&rdquo;
alone would be fascinating material and the cosmic
clashes of will possible under these conceived conditions
suggest thrilling stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Dreams constitute another definite source for ghostly
plots in modern literature. While this was true to a
certain extent in the Gothic novel, it is still more so in
later fiction. Lafcadio Hearn<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> advances the theory that
all the best plots for ghost stories in any language come
from dreams. He advises the person who would write
supernatural thrillers to study the phases of his own dream
life. It would appear that all one needs to do is to look
into his own nightmares and write. Hearn says: &ldquo;All
the great effects produced by poets and story writers and
even by religious teachers, in the treatment of the supernatural
fear or mystery, have been obtained directly or
indirectly from dreams.&rdquo; Though one may not literally
accept the whole of that statement, one must feel that the
relation between dreams and supernatural impressions
is strikingly close. The feeling of supernatural presence
comes almost always at night when one is or has been
asleep. The guilty man, awaking from sleep, thinks that
he sees the specters of those he has wronged&mdash;because
his dreams have embodied them for him. The lover
beholds the spirit of his dead love, because in dreams his
soul has gone in search of her. Very young children are
unable to distinguish between dreams and reality, as is
the case of savages of a low order, believing in the actuality
of what they experience in dreams. And who can say
that our dream life is altogether baseless and unreal?</p>

<p>The different nightmare sensations, acute and vivid as
they are, can be analyzed to find parallelisms between
them and the ghostly plots. For example, take the
sensation, common in nightmares, of feeling yourself
falling from immeasurable height. The same thrill of
suspense is communicated by the climax in Lewis&rsquo;s and
Mrs. Dacre&rsquo;s Gothic novels, where the devil takes guilty
mortals to the mountain top and hurls them down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
down. The horrible potentialities of shadows suggested
frequently in dreams is illustrated by Mary Wilkins
Freeman&rsquo;s story where the accusing spirit comes back as a
haunting shadow on the wall, rather than as an ordinary
ghost, tormenting the living brother till <em>his</em> shadow also
appears, a portent of his death.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The awful grip of causeless
horror, of nameless fear which assails one so often
in nightmares is represented in <cite>The Red Room</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> where
black Fear, the Power of Darkness, haunts the room rather
than any personal spirit. It is disembodied horror
itself. Wilkie Collins illustrates the presaging vision
of approaching disaster in <cite>The Dream Woman</cite>. The
nightmare horror of supernaturalism is nowhere better
shown than in Maupassant&rsquo;s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Horla</cite> where the sleeper
wakes with a sense of leaden weight upon his breast, and
knows that night after night some dreadful presence is
shut in with him, invisible yet crushing the life out of him
and driving him mad.</p>

<p>The nightmare motifs are present to a remarkable
degree in Bulwer-Lytton&rsquo;s <cite>The Haunted and the Haunters,
or the House and the Brain</cite>. There we have the gigantism
of the menacing Thing, the supernatural power given to
inanimate objects, the ghostly chill, the darkness, and the
intolerable oppression of a nameless evil thing beside
one. Vampirism might easily be an outcome of dreams,
since based on a physical sensation of pricking at the
throat, combined with debility caused by weakness,
which could be attributed to loss of blood from the ravages
of vampires. F. Marion Crawford&rsquo;s story, <cite>For the Blood
Is the Life</cite>, is more closely related to dreams than most of
the type, though probably Bram Stoker&rsquo;s <cite>Dracula</cite> is the
most horrible.</p>

<p>The curious side of supernaturalism as related to
dreams is illustrated by <i>The Dream Gown of the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Ambassador</i>,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and the more beautiful by Simeon
Solomon&rsquo;s <cite>Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep</cite>. Mary Wilkins
Freeman has a remarkable short story, <cite>The Hall
Bedroom</cite>, which is one of the best illustrations of the
use of dream imagery and impressions. Here the effects
are alluring and beautiful, with the horror kept
in the background, but perhaps the more effective because
of the artistic restraint. Odors, sights, sounds,
feelings, are all raised to an intensity of sensuous, slumbrous
enjoyment, all subliminated above the mortal.
The description of the river in the picture, on which the
young man floats away to dreamy death, similar to the
Japanese story referred to by Hearn, helps to give the impression
of infinity that comes only in dreams. Algernon
Blackwood in numerous stories not only uses the
elements of dreams and nightmares but explicitly calls
attention to the fact. Dream supernaturalism is employed
in Barry Pain&rsquo;s stories, in Arthur Machen&rsquo;s volume,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
and in many others. Freud&rsquo;s theory of dreams as the
invariable result of past experiences or unconscious desires
has not been stressed in fiction, though doubtless it will
have its inning presently. A. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s <cite>The Secret
of Goresthorpe Grange</cite> is an amusing story of the relation
of definite wishes and dreams of the ghostly.</p>

<p>These are some of the sources from which the later
writers of occultism have drawn their plots. They
represent a distinct advance over the Gothic and earlier
supernaturalism in materials, for the modern story has
gained the new elements without loss of the old. The
ghostly fiction of to-day has access to the animistic or
classical or medieval themes, yet has the unlimited province
of present thought to furnish additional inspiration.
There never was a time when thinking along general lines
was more spontaneously reflected in fiction than now, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
supernatural literature claims all regions for its own.
Like every other phase of man&rsquo;s thought, ghostly fiction
shows the increasing complexity of form and matter, the
wealth of added material and abounding richness of
style, the fine subtleties that only modernity can give.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="stl1">MODERN GHOSTS</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> ghost is the most enduring figure in supernatural
fiction. He is absolutely indestructible.
He glides from the freshly-cut pages of magazines
and books bearing the date of the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred and seventeen as from the parchment rolls of
ancient manuscripts. He appears as unapologetically at
home in twentieth century fiction as in classical mythology,
Christian hagiology, medieval legend, or Gothic romance.
He changes with the styles in fiction but he never goes
out of fashion. He is the really permanent citizen of this
earth, for mortals, at best, are but transients. Even the
athlete and the Methusaleh must in the end give up the
flesh, but the wraith goes on forever. In form, too, he
wears well. Ghostly substance of materialization, ethereal
and vaporous as it appears to be, is yet of an astonishing
toughness. It seems to possess an obstinate vitality
akin to that attributed to the boll weevil in a negro ballad,
that went on undaunted by heat or cold, rain or drought,
time or tide. The ghost, like death, has all seasons for
its own and there is no closed season for spooks. It is
much the case now as ever that all the world loves a ghost,
yet we like to take our ghosts vicariously, preferably in
fiction. We&rsquo;d rather see than be one.</p>

<p>One point of difference between the ghostly fiction of the
past and of the present is in the matter of length. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Gothic novel was often a three- or four-decker affair in
whose perusal the reader aged perceptibly before the ghost
succeeded or was foiled in his haunting designs. There
was obviously much more leisure on the part of spooks
as well as mortals then than now. Consequently the
ghost story of to-day is told in short-story form for the
most part. Poe knew better than anybody before him
what was necessary for the proper economy of thrills
when he gave his dictum concerning the desirable length
for a story, which rule applies more to the ghostly
tale than to any other type, for surely there is needed
the unity of impression, the definiteness of effect which
only continuity in reading gives. The ghostly narrative
that is too long loses in impressiveness, whether it is
altogether supernatural or mixed with other elements.
In either case, it is less successful than the shorter, more
poignant treatment possible in the compressed form.
The tabloid ghost can communicate more thrills than the
one in diluted narration.</p>

<p>The apparitions in later English fiction fall naturally
into several distinct classes with reference to the reality
of their appearance. There are the mistaken apparitions,
there are the purely subjective specters, evoked by the
psychic state of the percipients, and there are the objective
ghosts, independent of the mental state of the witnesses,
appearing to persons who are not mentally prepared
to see them.</p>

<p>The mistaken ghost is an old form, for most of Mrs.
Radcliffe&rsquo;s interesting apparitions belong to this class
and others of the Gothic writers used subterfuge to
cheat the reader. In the early romance there was frequently
deliberate deception for a definite purpose, the
ghosts with the histrionic temperament using a make-up
of phosphorus, bones, and other contrivances to create
the impression of unearthly visitation. Recent fiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
is more cleverly managed than that. Rarely now does
one find a story where the ghost-seer is deliberately imposed
upon, for in most modern cases the mistake occurs
by accident or misapprehension on the part of the percipient,
for which nobody and nothing but his own agitation
is responsible. Yet there are occasional hoax ghosts
even yet, for example, <cite>The Ghost of Miser Brimpson</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
where a specter is rigged up as the scheme of a clever girl
to win over an obdurate lover, and <cite>The Spectre Bridegroom</cite>,
which is a well-known example of the pseudo-spook
whose object is matrimony. <cite>His Unquiet Ghost</cite><a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> is a
delightful story of a fake burial to evade the revenue
officials. Watt, the &ldquo;corp,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;I was a powerful
onchancy, onquiet ghost. I even did my courtin&rsquo; whilst
in my reg&rsquo;lar line o&rsquo; business a&rsquo;harntin&rsquo; a graveyard!&rdquo;
His sweetheart sobs out her confession of love to &ldquo;his
pore ghost,&rdquo; an avowal she has denied the living man.
Examples of the apparitions that unwittingly deceive
mortals are found in <cite>The Ghost at Point of Rock</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> where
the young telegraph operator, alone at night on a prairie,
sees a beautiful girl who enters and announces that
she is dead,&mdash;how is he to know that she is in a somnambulistic
stupor, and has wandered from a train?
Another is<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> a story where the young man falls in love with
what he thinks is a wraith of the water luring him to his
death, but learns that she is a perfectly proper damsel
whose family he knows. <cite>The Night Call</cite><a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> is less simple
than these, a problematic story that leaves one wondering
as to just what is meant.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The subjective ghosts are legion in modern fiction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
They are those evoked by the mental state of the percipients
so that they become realities to those beholding
them. The mind rendered morbid by grief or remorse
is readily prepared to see the spirits of the dead return in
love or with reproach. The apparitions in animistic
beliefs, as in classical stories and Gothic romance, were
usually subjective, born of brooding love or remorse
or fear of retribution, appearing to the persons who
had cause to expect them and coming usually at night
when the beholders would be alone and given over to
melancholy thought or else to troubled sleep. Shakespeare&rsquo;s
ghosts were in large measure subjective, &ldquo;selective
apparitions.&rdquo; When Brutus asked the specter what he
was, the awful answer came, &ldquo;Thy evil genius, Brutus!&rdquo;
Macbeth saw the witches who embodied for him his own
secret ambitions, and he alone saw the ghost of Banquo,
because he had the weight of murder on his heart.</p>

<p>The subjective ghost story is difficult to write, as the
effect must be subtly managed yet inescapably impressive.
If done well it is admirable, and there are some writers
who, to use Henry James&rsquo;s words concerning his own work,
are &ldquo;more interested in situations obscure and subject to
interpretation than the gross rattle of the foreground.&rdquo;
The reader, as well as the writer, must put himself in the
mental attitude of acceptance of the supernatural else the
effect is lacking, for the ghostly thrill is incommunicable
to those beyond the pale of at least temporary credulity.</p>

<p>Kipling&rsquo;s <cite>They</cite> is an extraordinary ghost story of suggestion
rather than of bald fact. It is like crushing the
wings of a butterfly to analyze it, but it represents the
story of a man whose love for his own dead child enabled
him to see the spirits of other little children, because he
loved. As the blind woman told him, only those who were
spiritually prepared could see them, for &ldquo;you must bear
or lose!&rdquo; before glimpsing them. Thomas Bailey Aldrich&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<cite>Miss Mehitabel&rsquo;s Son</cite> is a humorously pathetic
account of the subjective spirit of a child that was never
born. Algernon Blackwood&rsquo;s ghosts are to a great
extent subjective. As John Silence, the psychic doctor,
says to the shuddering man who has had a racking experience:
&ldquo;Your deeply introspective mood had already
reconstructed the past so intensely that you were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rapport</i>
at once with any forces of those past days that
chanced to be still lingering. And they swept you up all
unresistingly.&rdquo; In <cite>The Shell of Sense</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> the woman who is
about to accept her dead sister&rsquo;s husband feels such a sense
of disloyalty that she sees the sister&rsquo;s spirit reproaching
her. Her conscience has prepared her for the vision.
Juliet Wilbur Tompkins shows us the spirit of a mother
returning to comfort the daughter who has in life misunderstood
and neglected her, but now, realizing the truth,
is grieving her heart out for her.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Ambrose Bierce tells
of a prisoner who murders his jailer to escape, but is
arrested and brought back by the spirit of the dead man.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Any number of instances might be given of ghosts appearing
to those who are mentally prepared to be receptive
to supernatural visions, but these will serve to illustrate
the type.</p>

<p>Objective ghosts are likewise very numerous in modern
fiction. The objective spirits are those that, while they
may be subjective on the part of the persons chiefly
concerned, to begin with, are yet visible to others as well,
appearing not only to those mentally prepared to see them
but to others not thinking of such manifestations and
even sceptical of their possibility. The objective ghosts
have more definite visibility, more reality than the purely
subjective spirits. They are more impressive as haunters.
There is a plausibility, a corporeality about the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
apparitions that shows their advance over the diaphanous
phantoms of the past. Ghosts that eat and drink, play
cards, dance, duel, and do anything they wish, that are
so lifelike in their materialization that they would deceive
even a medium, are more terrifying than the helpless
specters of early times that could only give orders for
the living to carry out. The modern ghost has lost none
of his mortal powers but has gained additional supermortal
abilities, which gives him an unsportsmanlike
advantage over the mere human being he may take issue
with.</p>

<p>Henry James&rsquo;s <cite>The Turn of the Screw</cite> is a remarkable
example of the objective ghost story. It is one of the
best ghostly stories in English, because more philosophical,
showing more knowledge of the psychology not only of the
adult but of the child, not only of the human being but
of the ghost, than most fiction of the type. Peter Quint
and Miss Jessel with their diabolical conspiracy of evil
against the two children are so real that they are seen not
only by the children they hound but by the unsuspecting
governess as well. She is able to describe them so accurately
that those who knew them in life&mdash;as she did not
at all&mdash;recognize them instantly. In <cite>The Four-fifteen
Express</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> John Derringer&rsquo;s ghost is seen by a man that
does not know he is dead, and who has not been thinking
of him at all. The ghost reveals incontrovertible proof
of his presence, even leaving his cigar-case behind him,&mdash;which
raises the question as to whether ghosts smoke in
the hereafter in more ways than one. The ghastly incident
in Emily Brontë&rsquo;s <cite>Wuthering Heights</cite> where the
agonized ghost comes to the window, gashing its wrist on
the broken pane, is strikingly objectified, for she comes to
a person who never knew her and is not thinking of any
supernatural manifestation. <cite>Shadows on the Wall</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
story of surpassing power of suggestion, is objective in its
method, for not only the man who has wronged his dead
mother sees his spirit returning, not in the ordinary way
but as an accusing shadow on the wall, but the sisters
see it as well.</p>

<p>In <cite>John Inglesant</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> the spirit of Lord Strafford is
seen by the young lad in the vestibule as well as by the
king whose conscience burns for having left him to die
undefended. Frank R. Stockton&rsquo;s transferred ghost
is an objective apparition, for surely the guest in the
upper chamber was not expecting to see the shade of a
living man perch itself on the foot of his bed at midnight.
The horrible specter in <cite>The Messenger</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> is seen by various
persons at different times, some of whom are totally
unprepared for such exhibition. And many similar
instances might be given.</p>

<p>Whether ghosts be mistaken, subjective or objective,
their appearance has always elicited considerable interest
on the part of humanity. Their substance of materialization,
their bearing, dress, and general demeanor are
matters of definite concern to those who expect shortly
to become ghosts themselves. In some instances the
modern ghost sticks pretty closely to the animistic
idea of spirit material, which was that the shade was
a sort of vapory projection of the body, intangible, impalpable,
yet easily recognized with reference to previous
personality. Chaucer describes some one as being &ldquo;nat
pale as a forpyned goost,&rdquo; which illustrates the conception
in his day, and the Gothic specimen was usually a pallid
specter, though Walpole furnished one robust haunter of
gigantic muscle. Yet for the most part the Gothic ghosts
were misty wraiths, through which the sword could
plunge without resistance. They were fragile and helpless
as an eighteenth-century heroine when it came to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
real emergency, and were useful chiefly for frightening
the guilty and consoling the innocent. In some stories
of the present we have a similar materialization. The
spirit woman in Kipling&rsquo;s <cite>Phantom Rickshaw</cite> is so ethereal
that the horse and its rider plunge through her without
resistance, and Dickens&rsquo;s Mr. Marley is of such vapory
substance that Scrooge can see clear through him to count
the coat-tail buttons at his back. In a recent story,
<cite>The Substitute</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> the spirit is said to evade her friend like
a mist.</p>

<p>The Gothic ghost frequently walked forth as a skeleton,
clad in nothing but his bones and a lurid scowl. Skeletons
still perambulate among us, as in <cite>The Messenger</cite>,
where the stripped-off mask shows a hideous skull.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The skeleton burst from out the rotting robes and collapsed
on the ground before us. From between the staring ribs and
the grinning teeth spurted a torrent of black blood, showering
the shrinking grasses, and then the thing shuddered and fell
over into the black ooze of the bog.</p>
</div>

<p>The ghost of Zuleika<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> is described as &ldquo;a skeleton woman
robed in the ragged remains of a black mantle.
Near this crumbling earth body there lay the spirit of
Zuleika attached to it by a fine thread of magnetic ether.
Like the earthly body it was wrapped in a robe of black
of which it seemed the counterpart.&rdquo; Elliott O&rsquo;Donnell
has a story of a mummy that in a soldier&rsquo;s tent at night
sobs, breathes, moves, sits up, and with ghastly fingers
unfolds its cere-cloth wrappings, appearing to him as
the counterpart of his long-dead mother, looking at
him with the eyes he had worshiped in his boyhood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I fell on my knees before her and kissed&mdash;what? Not the
feet of my mother but those of the long-buried dead! Sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with repulsion and fear I looked up and there bending over
me and peering into my eyes was the face, the fleshless,
mouldering face of the foul corpse!</p>
</div>

<p>But on the whole, though skeletons do appear in later
fiction, the rattle of bones is not heard as often as in
Gothic times.</p>

<p>Ghostly apparitions are more varied in form than in
early times. The modern ghost does not require a whole
skeleton for his purposes, but he can take a single bone
and put the hardiest to flight with it. It is a dreadful thing
to realize that a ghost can come in sections, which indefinitely
multiplies its powers of haunting. F. Marion
Crawford has a story of a diabolical skull, one of the most
rabid revenge ghosts on record. A man has murdered his
wife by pouring melted lead into her ear while she slept,
in accordance with a suggestion from a casually told story
of a guest. The dead woman&rsquo;s skull&mdash;the husband cut the
head off for fear people would hear the lead rattle, and
buried it in the garden&mdash;comes back to haunt the husband,
with that deadly rattle of the lump of lead inside. The
teeth bite him, the skull rolls up a hill to follow him, and
finally kills him, then sets in to haunt the visitor who told
the suggestive story.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Elsewhere as well Crawford shows
us skulls that have uncanny powers of motion and emotion.
In Wilkie Collins&rsquo;s <cite>Haunted Hotel</cite> the specter is seen
as a bodiless head floating near the ceiling of the room
where the man was murdered and his body concealed.
Thackeray<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> describes a ghost with its head on its lap,
and of course every one will remember the headless horseman
with his head carried on the pommel of his saddle that
frightened poor Ichabod Crane out of his wits.</p>

<p>We get a rabble of headless apparitions in <cite>Brissot&rsquo;s
Ghost</cite>, one of the Anti-Jacobin parodies (ridiculing Richard
Glover&rsquo;s ballad of Hosier&rsquo;s Ghost):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sudden up the staircase sounding<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hideous yells and shrieks were heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, each guest with fear confounding,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A grim train of ghosts appeared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each a head in anguish gasping<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Himself a trunk deformed with gore)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his hand, terrific clasping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stalked across the wine-stained floor.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In Bulwer-Lytton&rsquo;s <cite>The Haunters and the Haunted</cite> a
woman&rsquo;s hand without a body rises up to clutch the ancient
letters, then withdraws, while in his <cite>Strange Story</cite> the
supernatural manifestation comes as a vast Eye seen in the
distance, moving nearer and nearer, &ldquo;seeming to move
from the ground at a height of some lofty giant.&rdquo; Then
other Eyes appear. &ldquo;Those Eyes! Those terrible Eyes!
Legions on legions! And that tramp of numberless feet!
<em>they</em> are not seen, but the hollows of the earth echo to their
tread!&rdquo; The supernatural phenomena in Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s
stories have an individual horror. In <cite>A Vine on the
House</cite> he shows a hideous revenge ghost manifested in a
peculiar form. A couple of men take refuge in a deserted
house and note a strange vine covering the porch that
shakes unaccountably and violently. In mystification
they dig it up, to find the roots in the form of a woman&rsquo;s
body, lacking one foot, as had been the case with the
woman who had lived there and whose husband had
killed her secretly and buried her beside the porch.</p>

<p>The revenge ghost in modern fiction frequently manifests
itself in this form, mutilated or dismembered, each
disfigurement of the mortal body showing itself in a
relentless immortality and adding to the horror of the
haunting. There seems to be no seat of ghostly mind or
soul, for the body can perform its function of haunting
in whole or in part, unaided by the head or heart, like a
section of a snake that has life apart from the main body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
And this idea of detached part of the form acting as a
determined agent for revenge adds a new horror to fiction.
I haven&rsquo;t as yet found an instance of a woman&rsquo;s
heart, bleeding and broken, coming up all by itself to
haunt the deserting lover, but perhaps such stories will be
written soon. And think what terrors would await the
careless physician or surgeon if each outraged organ
or dismembered limb came back to seek vengeance on
him!</p>

<p>Ghosts of modern fiction are more convincing in their
reality than the specters of early times. They are
stronger, more vital; there seems to be a strengthening of
ghostly tissue, a stiffening of supernatural muscle in these
days. Ghosts are more healthy, more active, more alive
than they used to be. There is now as before a strong
resemblance to the personality before death, the same
immortality of looks that is discouraging to the prospects
of homely persons who have hoped to be more handsome
in a future state. Fiction gives no basis for such hope.
Peculiarities of appearance are carried over with distressing
faithfulness to detail, each freckle, each wrinkle, each
gray hair showing with the clearness of a photographic
proof. Note the lifelikeness of the governess&rsquo;s description
of Peter Quint in <cite>The Turn of the Screw</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>He has red hair, very red, very close-curling, and a pale
face, long in shape, with straight, good features and little
queer whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are
somehow darker and particularly arched as if they might
move a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange, awful. His
mouth is wide, his lips thin.</p>
</div>

<p>This seems an unspectral description, for red hair is not
wraith-like, yet a red-headed ghost that lifted its eyebrows
unnaturally would be alarming. She says of him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
&ldquo;He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, dangerous,
detestable presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each minor disfigurement is retained, as the loss of the
tooth in Crawford&rsquo;s screaming skull, the missing toe in
Bierce&rsquo;s <cite>Middle Toe of the Right Foot</cite>, the lacking foot
in the ghostly vine, and so forth. Nothing is neglected to
make identification absolute in present tales of horror.
The spirits described by Bram Stoker have red, voluptuous
lips and pink cheeks, and the spirit of Sir Oliver&rsquo;s
mother, in De Morgan&rsquo;s <cite>An Affair of Dishonor</cite>, that comes
to meet him as he passes her mausoleum on his way to the
shameful duel, limps as in life, so that he recognizes her,
though the cloaked and hooded figure has its face turned
from him. Jessie Adelaide Middleton shows us one ghost
with half a face.</p>

<p>Ghostly apparel constitutes an interesting feature of
supernaturalism in literature. There seem to be as definite
conventions concerning spectral clothes as regarding
the garb of the living fashionables. It is more difficult
to understand the immortality of clothes than of humanity,
for bodily tissue even of ghosts might quite conceivably
renew itself, but not so with the ghostly garments.
Of what stuff are ghost-clothes made? And why do they
never wear out?</p>

<p>In olden times when people wore clothes of less radical
styles than now and fewer of them, masculine spirits were
in part identified by their familiar armor. Armor is so
material and heavy that it seems incongruous to the
ghostly function, yet shields and accouterments were
necessary accompaniments of every knightly spook. He
must be ever ready to tilt with rival ghost. The Gothic
phantoms were well panoplied and one remembers particularly
the giant armor in Walpole&rsquo;s novel. Nowadays
the law forbids the carrying of weapons, which restriction
seems to have been extended to ghostdom as well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Specters are thus placed at a disadvantage, for one would
scarcely expect to see even the wraith of a Texas cow-boy
toting a pistol.</p>

<p>Specters usually appear in the garments in which the
beholder saw them last in life. Styles seem petrified at
death so that old-time ghosts now look like figures from
the movies or guests at a masquerade ball. One other
point to be noted is that women phantoms are frequently
seen in black or in white. White seems reminiscent of the
shroud, as well as of youth and innocence, so is appropriate,
while black connotes gloom, so is suitable, yet the
really favored color is gray. Most of the specters this
season are dressed in gray. I scarcely know why this is
affected by shades, yet the fact remains that many wraiths
both men and women are thus attired. Gray is the tone
that witches of modern tastes choose also, whereas their
ancient forbears went in black and red. Modern ghosts
are at a disadvantage in the matter of clothes compared
with the earlier ones, since the styles now change so quickly
and so decidedly that a ghost is hopelessly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé</i> before he
has time to materialize at all in most instances.</p>

<p>Examples of ghostly garments in later fiction evidence
their variety. Katherine Fullerton Gerould<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> shows us
three ghosts, one of a woman in a blue dress, one of a rattlesnake,
and one of a Zulu warrior wearing only a loin-cloth,
a nose-ring, and a scowl. (We do not often see the
nude in ghosts, perhaps because they have a shade of
modesty.) <cite>Co-operative Ghosts</cite><a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> depicts a man clad
in the wraith of a tweed suit, mid-Victorian, &ldquo;with those
familiar Matthew Arnold side-whiskers.&rdquo; In addition to
Mr. Morley&rsquo;s coat-tail buttons which we glanced through
him to see, we observe that he wears ghostly spectacles, a
pig-tail, tights and boots, and a prim waist-coat. In Kipling&rsquo;s
<cite>They</cite> we see the glint of a small boy&rsquo;s blue blouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
while another Kipling youngster, a war-ghost,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> struts
around in his comical first trousers which he would not be
robbed of even by the German soldiers that murdered him.
Other children in the same story are said to have on &ldquo;disgracefully
dirty clothes.&rdquo; I do not recall any soilure on
Gothic garments, save spectral blood-stains and the
mold of graves. Neither did I discover any child wraith
in Gothicism save the pitiful spirits of baby victims in
<cite>The Albigenses</cite> and the baby wraiths in Hogg&rsquo;s <cite>The Wool-gatherer</cite>.
The Englishman driven mad by the apparition
of the woman he has wronged in Kipling&rsquo;s story<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> is described
by him as &ldquo;wearing the dress in which I saw her last
alive; she carried the same tiny handkerchief in her right
hand and the same card-case in her left.&rdquo; (A woman eight
months dead with a card-case!) Blackwood shows us a
ghost in purple knee-breeches and velvet coat; in <cite>The Gray
Guest</cite><a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> the returning Napoleon wears a long military cloak
of gray and military boots, while Crawford has one dreadful
ghost coming back to wreak revenge in wet oil-skins.
The eccentric spook in Josephine Daskam Bacon&rsquo;s <cite>The
Heritage</cite> is dressed in brown and sits stolidly and silently
on the side of the bed with its back turned. Think of
being haunted by an unbudging brown back! No wonder
it drove the young husband to spend his wedding night
huddled on the stairs. We have instances of a ghost
in a red vest, a relentless revenge spirit that hounds
from ocean to ocean his murderer and the betrayer of his
daughter, and another of a ghost in a red shirt. There
is on the whole as much variety and appropriateness
of costume in modern ghost fiction as in Broadway
melodrama.</p>

<p>Another point of difference between the specters of to-day
and those of the past is in the extension of their avenues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of approach to us. Ghostly appeal to the senses is
more varied now than in earlier times. The classical as
well as the Gothic ghosts appealed in general only to the
sight and hearing, as well as, of course, to the sixth sense
that realizes the presence of a supernatural being. Ghosts
were seen and heard and were content with that. But
nowadays more points of contact are open to them and
they haunt us through the touch, the smell, as well as sight
and hearing. The taste as a medium of impression has
not yet been exploited by fiction writers though doubtless
it will be worked out soon. There is a folk-tale of the
Skibos that wolves eat ghosts and find them very appetizing
and the devil in Poe&rsquo;s <cite>Bon Bon</cite> says he eats the spirits
of mortals. One might imagine what haunting dyspepsia
could result if an ill-tempered spook were devoured against
his will. It is conceivable, too, that gastronomic ghosts
might haunt cannibals; and who knows that the dark
brown taste in the mouths of riotous livers is not some
specter striving to express itself through that medium
instead of being <em>merely</em> riotous livers?</p>

<p>The appeal of ghosts to the sight has already been
discussed so need not be mentioned here. But the element
of invisibility enters in as a new and very terrible
form of supernatural manifestation in later fiction. In
spite of the general visibility, some of the most horrible
tales turn on the fact that the haunter is unseen. H.&nbsp;G.
Wells&rsquo;s <cite>Invisible Man</cite> is a human being, not a ghost; yet
the story has a curdling power that few straight ghost
stories possess. Maupassant&rsquo;s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Horla</cite> is a nightmare
story of an invisible being that is terrific in its effect. The
victim knows that an unseen yet definite and determined
something is shut in his room with him night after night,
eating, drinking, reading, sitting on his chest, driving him
mad. Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s <cite>The Damned Thing</cite> is a gruesome
story of invisibility, of a something that is abroad with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
unearthly power of evil, whose movements can be measured
by the bending of the grasses, which shuts off the
light from other objects as it passes, which struggles with
the dogs and with men, till it finally kills and horribly
mangles the man who has been studying it, but is never
seen. Another<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> has for its central figure a being that
violently attacks men and is overpowered and tied only by
abnormal strength, that struggles on the bed, showing its
imprint on the mattress, that is imprisoned in a plaster
cast to have its mold taken, that is heard breathing
loudly till it dies of starvation, yet is absolutely never
visible. Blackwood&rsquo;s Fire Elemental may be seen moving
along only by the bending of the grass beneath it and
by the trail it leaves behind, for though it is audible yet it
is never seen. As a brave man said of it, &ldquo;I am not afraid
of anything that I can <em>see</em>!&rdquo; so these stories of supernatural
invisibility have a chilling horror more intense than
that of most ghostly tales. The element of invisibility
of unmistakably present spirits is shown in other stories.</p>

<p>One tender story of an invisible ghost is told in <cite>In No
Strange Land</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> of a man killed suddenly in a wreck while
on his way home to the birthday dinner his wife is preparing
for him. He does not know that he has been hurt; but
while his dead body lies mangled under the wreckage his
spirit hurries home. He swears whimsically under his
breath at some interruption and thinks with joy of the
happy little group he will meet. But when he enters his
home he cannot make them see or hear him. They are
vaguely aware of some strange influence, are awed by it,
and the little son with the poet&rsquo;s heart whispers that he
hears something, but that is all. The man stands by,
impotently stretching out his arms to them till he hears
the messenger tell them that he is dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Ghosts are variable with respect to sounds as well as
appearance. The early ghosts were for the most part
silent, yet could talk on occasion, and classical apparitions
were sometimes vocal and sometimes silent. The
Gothic ghost sometimes had an impediment in his speech
while at other times he could converse fluently. The
Gothic specter, real as well as faked, frequently lifted
voice in song and brought terror to the guilty bosom by
such strains. Yet when he spoke he was usually brief in
utterance. Perhaps the reason for that lay in the lack of
surety on the part of the writers as to the proper ghostly
diction. Gothic authors were not overstrong on technique
and they may have hesitated to let their specters be
too fluent lest they be guilty of dialectic errors. It would
seem incongruous for even an illiterate ghost to murder the
king&rsquo;s English, which presents a difficulty in the matter
of realism, so perchance the writers dodged the issue by
giving their ghosts brevity of speech, or in some cases by
letting them look volumes of threats but utter no word.
This may explain the reason for the non-speaking ghosts
in classical and Elizabethan drama. There is a similar
variation in the later fiction, for many of the ghosts are
eloquently silent, while other phantoms are terrifyingly
fluent. All this goes to prove the freedom of the modern
ghost for he does what he takes a notion to do. The
invisible ghosts are as a rule voiceless as well.</p>

<p>The Gothic romance was fond of mysterious music
as an accompaniment of supernatural visitation, but
ghostly music is less common than it used to be. Yet
it does come at times, as in <cite>A Far-away Melody</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> where
two spinster sisters living alone hear heavenly music
as portent of their death. Ghostly song is heard in
another case,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> where a woman&rsquo;s spirit comes back to
sing in a duet at her funeral, and Crawford&rsquo;s ghost<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
constantly whistles a tune he had been fond of during life.
In <cite>Co-operative Ghosts</cite> the wraith of the young girl who in
Cromwellian times betrayed her father&rsquo;s cause to save her
lover&rsquo;s life sings sadly,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I could not love thee, dear, so much,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Loved I not honor more!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In Crawford&rsquo;s <cite>A Doll&rsquo;s Ghost</cite>, that peculiar example of
preternatural fiction, not a children&rsquo;s story as one might
think, nor yet humorous, the mechanical voice of the doll
and the click of its tiny pattering feet occur as strange
sounds. Lord Strafford<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> walks with a firm, audible tread
on his way to appall the king, and in Blackwood&rsquo;s <cite>Empty
House</cite> the ghosts move with sounds of heavy, rushing feet,
followed by a noise of scuffling and smothered screams as
the ancient murder is re-enacted, then the thud of a body
thrown down the stairs,&mdash;after which is a terrible silence.
The awful effect of a sudden silence after supernatural
sounds is nowhere shown more tensely than in <cite>The Monkey&rsquo;s
Paw</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> that story of superlative power of suggestion.
When the ghostly visitant knocks loudly at the outer door,
we feel the same thrill of chilling awe as in the knocking at
the gate in Macbeth, and more, for the two who hear are
sure that this is a presence come back from the dead.
Then when the last magic wish has been breathed, utter
silence comes, a silence more dreadful in its import than
the clamor has been.</p>

<p>New sounds are introduced in modern ghostly tales,
such as the peculiar hissing that is a manifestation of the
presence of the ancient spirit<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> followed by the crackling
and crashing of the enchanted flames. In Blackwood&rsquo;s
<cite>Keeping His Promise</cite> the heavy, stertorous breathing of
the invisible Thing is heard, and the creaking of the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
weighted down by the body. Mary Wilkins Freeman
brings in ghostly crying in a story, while Blackwood speaks
of his Wendigo as having &ldquo;a sort of windy, crying voice,
as of something lonely and untamed, wild and of abominable
power.&rdquo; Kipling introduces novel and touching
sounds in his stories of ghostly children. The child-wraiths
are gay, yet sometimes near to tears. He speaks
of &ldquo;the utterly happy chuckle of a child absorbed in some
light mischief,&rdquo; &ldquo;sudden, squeaking giggles of childhood,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the rustle of a frock and the patter of feet in
the room beyond,&rdquo; &ldquo;joyous chuckles of evasion,&rdquo; and
so forth. These essentially childlike and lifelike sounds
are deeply pathetic as coming from the ghosts of little
ones that hover, homesick, near the earth they dread to
leave. The little ghost boy in Richard Middleton&rsquo;s
story,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> manifests himself, invisibly, through the little
prancing steps, the rustling of the leaves through which he
runs, and the heart-breaking imitations of an automobile.
Later ghostly fiction introduces few of the clankings
of chains and lugubrious groans that made the Gothic
romance mournful, and the modern specters are less wailful
than the earlier, but more articulate in their expression.
There are definite ghostly sounds that recur in
various stories, such as the death-rap above the bed of the
dying, the oft-mentioned mocking laughter in empty
places, the cry of the banshee which is the presage of
death not only of the body but of the soul, as well. On
the whole, the sounds in modern supernatural stories are
more varied in their types, more expressive of separate
and individual horror, and with an intensified power of
haunting suggestion than was the case with the earlier
forms.</p>

<p>The sense of smell was not noticeably exploited in the
ancient or Gothic ghost stories, though certain folk-tales,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
as Hawaiian stories of the lower world, speak of it. The
devil was supposed to be in bad odor, for he was usually
accompanied by sulphurous scents, as we notice in
Calderon&rsquo;s drama,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and some of the Gothic novels, but
that seems to be about the extent of the matter. But
moderns, while not so partial to brimstone, pay considerable
attention to supernatural odors. The devil has been
dry-cleaned, but the evil odors of later fiction are more
objectionable than the fumes of the pit, are more variant,
more individual and distinctive. Odors seem less
subjective than sights or sounds, and are not so conventionalized
in ghostly fiction, hence when they are cleverly
evoked they are unusually effective. These supernatural
scents have a very lasting quality too, for they linger on
after the other manifestations of the preternatural are
past. In <cite>The Haunted Hotel</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> the ghost manifests itself
through the nostrils. In room number thirteen there is
an awful stench for which no one can account, and which
cannot be removed by any disinfectants. Finally when
a woman especially sympathetic to a man mysteriously
dead is put in the room, the ghost appears as a decaying
head, floating near the ceiling and emitting an intolerable
odor. <cite>The Upper Berth</cite><a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> tells of a strange, foul sea odor
that infests a certain stateroom and that no amount of
fumigating or airing will remove. As the Thing comes out
of the sea to carry its victim away with it, the man in the
lower berth gets the full force of the unearthly smell.
There are definite foul supernatural odors associated with
supernatural animals in recent ghostly tales, as that &ldquo;ghost
of an unforgettable strange odor, of a queer, acrid, pungent
smell like the odor of lions,&rdquo; which announces the presence
of the awful out-door something called by the Indians,
the Wendigo. In Kipling&rsquo;s story<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> of a man whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
soul has been stolen by Indian magic through the curse of
a leper priest and a beast&rsquo;s soul put in its place,&mdash;his companions
are sickened by an intolerable stench as of wild
beasts, and when the curse is removed and he comes back
to himself, he sniffs the air and asks what causes &ldquo;such a
horrid doggy smell in the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes the ghastly presence comes as a whiff of
perfume,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> where the spirit of the dead woman brings
with it flowers in masses, with a heavenly perfume which
lingers after the spirit in visible form has departed. The
subtlest and most delicately haunting story of this type is
O. Henry&rsquo;s,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> where the loved, dead girl reveals herself
to the man who is desperately hunting the big city over
for her, merely as a whiff of mignonette, the flower she
most loved.</p>

<p>But it is through the sense of touch that the worst form
of haunting comes. Seeing a supernatural visitant is
terrible, hearing him is direful, smelling him is loathsome,
but having him touch you is the climax of horror. This
element comes in much in recent stories. The earlier
ghosts seemed to be more reserved, to know their spectral
place better, were not so ready to presume on unwelcome
familiarities as those in later fiction, but spooks have
doubtless followed the fashion of mortals in this easy,
relaxed age and have become a shade too free in their
manners. Of course, one remembers the crushing specter
in Otranto castle that flattened the hapless youth out so
effectually, and there are other instances less striking.
But as a general thing the Gothic ghost was content to
stand at a distance and hurl curses. Fortunately for our
ancestors&rsquo; nerves, he did not incline much to the laying
on of hands. Modern ghosts, however, have not been
taught to restrain their impulses and they venture on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
liberties that Radcliffian romance would have disapproved
of.</p>

<p><cite>The Damned Thing</cite> gives an example of muscular
supernaturalism, for the mysterious being kills a dog in
a stiff fight, then later slays the master after a terrible
struggle in which the man is disfigured beyond words to
describe. O&rsquo;Brien shows a terrible being of abnormal
power that is tied only after a tremendous effort, and
which fights violently to free itself. And the Thing in the
upper berth had an awesome strength.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It was something ghostly, horrible, beyond words, and it
moved in my grasp. It was like the body of a man long dead
and yet it moved, and had the strength of ten men living,
but I gripped it with all my might, the slippery, oozy, horrible
thing. I wrestled with the dead thing; it thrust itself upon
me and nearly broke my arms; it wound its corpselike arms
around my neck, the living death, and overpowered me, so
that at the last I cried aloud and fell and left my hold.</p>

<p>As I fell the thing sprang across me and seemed to throw
itself upon the captain. When I last saw him on his feet his
face was white and his lips set. It seemed to me that he
struck a violent blow at the dead being, and then, he, too,
fell forward on his face.</p>
</div>

<p>The ghostly touch is frequently described, not only in
fiction but in reports of the Psychical Society as well, as
being of supernatural chill or of burning heat. <cite>Afterwards</cite><a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
brings in the icy touch of the spirit hand. In certain
cases the ghost touch leaves a burn or mark that
never goes away.</p>

<p>Yet the touch of horror is not the only one introduced
in fiction of the supernatural. There are tender and
loving touches as well, expressing yearning love and a
longing to communicate with the living. What could
be more beautiful than the incident in <cite>They</cite>? &ldquo;I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
my relaxed hand taken and turned softly between the soft
hands of a child. The little brushing kiss fell in the center
of my palm&mdash;as gift on which the fingers were <em>once</em> expected
to close&mdash;a fragment of a mute code devised very long ago.&rdquo;
And in a similar story,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> the woman says, &ldquo;I will swear to
my dying day that two little hands stole and rested&mdash;for a
moment only&mdash;in mine!&rdquo; Wilkie Collins speaks of his
story, <cite>The Ghost&rsquo;s Touch</cite>, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The course of this narrative leads the reader on new and
strange ground. It describes the return of a disembodied
spirit to earth&mdash;not occurring in the obscurity of midnight
but in the searching light of day; neither seen as a vision nor
heard as a voice&mdash;revealing itself to mortal knowledge through
the sense that is least easily self-deceived, the sense that feels.</p>
</div>

<p>The widow feels the clasp of her husband&rsquo;s hands, not
only psychically but physically, and when she asks for a
further sign, the ghost kisses her unmistakably on the lips.
Another widow<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> feels her hand clasped by the hand of her
husband who has mysteriously disappeared after having
presumably absconded with trust funds&mdash;and knows that
he is dead and seeking to give her some message. His
hand gently leads her to the edge of the cliff where he has
fallen over and been killed, so that she may know the
truth. The lover in Poe&rsquo;s <cite>Eleonora</cite> feels a &ldquo;spiritual kiss&rdquo;
from the lips of his beloved. The ghost touch is an impressive
motif of strength in recent fiction and marks
an advance over the earlier forms, showing an access of
imaginative power and psychological analysis.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another point of contrast between the modern and the
older ghosts is in the greater freedom enjoyed by those of
to-day. The ghosts of our ancestors were weak and
helpless creatures in the main and the Gothic specter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
tyrannized over to such an extent that he hardly dared
call his shade his own. The spook of to-day has acquired a
latchkey and asserted his independence. He may have a
local habitation but he isn&rsquo;t obliged to stay there. Now-a-days
even the spectral women are setting up to be
feminists and have privileges that would have caused the
Gothic wraiths to swoon with horror. Ghosts are not so
sensitive to the barometer now as they used to be, nor do
they have such an active influence over the weather as did
the Gothic phantoms. They do not need a tempest for their
materialization nor a supernatural play of lightning for
their wild threats, and comparatively few storms occur
in later fiction. Yet there is certainly no lessening of the
ghostly thrill in consequence.</p>

<p>Neither are the spirits of to-day limited to any set hours
as was the rule in Gothicism. The tyranny of the dark,
the autocratic rule of twelve or one o&rsquo;clock as the arbitrary
hour for apparitions, has been removed. Katherine Fullerton
Gerould shows an interesting collection of ghosts that
come at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Georgia Wood
Pangborn brings one out on the seashore in mid-afternoon,
and Kipling has various ghosts that appear in daylight
and in the open air.</p>

<p>Ghosts in modern fiction are not dependent upon a setting
of sullen scenery as in Gothicism, but may choose any
surroundings they like. Since modern household arrangements
do not include family vaults as a general thing, and
since cemeteries are inconveniently located, there is a
tendency on the part of haunters to desert such quarters.
Mary Wilkins Freeman and Charles Egbert Craddock
each has one ghost story located in a graveyard, and
<cite>The Last Ghost in Harmony</cite><a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> is set in a burying-ground,
but the specter complains loudly of the unsentimental
mind of the town which has lost interest in ghosts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
leaves in disgust. Likewise the domination of the Gothic
castles, those &ldquo;ghaist-alluring edifices,&rdquo; has passed away
and modern spooks are not confined to any one locality as
in the past. They appear where they will, in the most
prosaic places, in cheap lodging-houses, in hall bedrooms,
in bungalows, in the staterooms of steamers, on tramp
ships, and so forth. Algernon Blackwood has set a number
of thrilling ghost stories out in the open, in the woods,
in the desert sand wastes, and similar places. One effect
of such realistic and unspectral setting is to give a greater
verisimilitude to the events described, and the modern tale
bears out Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s suggestion that &ldquo;a ghost story, to
be a good one, should unite, as much as possible, objects
as they are in life, with a preternatural spirit.&rdquo; Yet
here are ghosts that do haunt certain rooms as relentlessly
as ever Gothic specter did.</p>

<p>The modern ghost has power over certain localities
rather than mere houses or apartments. If the house he
calls his own is torn down, he bides his time and haunts
the new structure built on the same spot. Or if no new
house goes up, he hangs around and haunts the vacant
lot, which is a more reprehensible procedure than the
ordinary habits of spooks. One story concerns a house so
persistently ghosted that its owner took it down section by
section, trying to arrive at the location of the curse, but
to no avail. When the whole building had been razed
and the site plowed over, the ghost undiscouraged
haunted merrily on. Then the owner left in disgust.
Algernon Blackwood is fond of situations where localities
are haunted by evil spirits,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> where a whole village
is inhabited by the ghosts of long-dead witches, or <cite>Secret
Worship</cite> that relates the experience of a man who wanders
within the limits of a place made horrible by devil-worshipers,
long-dead, but life-like, and inhabiting a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that has been torn down years before but appears as
usual, where they entrap the souls of the living for their
fiendish sacrifice. Another<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> is the record of a spirit of
frightful evil that haunts a house built on the spot where
an older house once stood, whose diabolism lingers on to
curse the living. The spirit that haunts a locality rather
than one room or house has a more malignant power than
the more restricted ghost and this adds a new element of
definite supernaturalism to modern fiction. But as houses
are so much less permanent now than formerly, ghosts
would be at a terrible disadvantage if they had to be evicted
every time a building was torn down.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ghostly psychology is a fascinating study. The development
of spectral personality is one of the evident
facts gained from a historical survey of supernatural
fiction. The modern ghost has more individuality, more
distinctiveness, in the main, than his forbears. The
ghosts of medievalism, of ancient superstition, and the
drama were for the most part pallid, colorless beings in
character as in materialization. The ancient ghosts were
more mournful than the moderns, since the state of the
dead in early times was by no means enviable. The
most one could hope for then was Hades, while the spirits
who hadn&rsquo;t been buried couldn&rsquo;t find entrance even there
but were forced by relentless spectral police to keep forever
moving. The Christian religion furnishes a more
cheerful outlook, so in later manifestations the gloom is
considerably lightened. Yet even so the Gothic ghosts
were morbid, low-minded specters not much happier than
the unlucky wights they felt it their business to haunt.
Their woe-begone visages, their clanking chains, and other
accompaniments of woe betokened anything but cheer.</p>

<p>There are some unhappy spirits in recent fiction, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
not such a large proportion as in the past. And there is
usually some basis for their joylessness; they don&rsquo;t have
general melancholia with no grounds for it. The ghost of
the dead wife in <cite>Readjustment</cite><a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> is miserable because she
has never understood her husband, either in life or in
death, and she comes back seeking an explanation. Another
spectral woman<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> is wretched because she has the
double crime of murder and suicide on her soul. Poor
Marley grieves because he is doomed to see the opportunities
that life has offered him to serve others and that he
has neglected, being forced to see with the clear vision of
the other world the evil results of his own neglect, which is
enough to make any one wretched. A guilty conscience is
like the burning heart that each spirit in the Hall of Eblis
bore in his breast. In <cite>The Roll-call of the Reef</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> the troop
of drowned soldiers, infantry, and horsemen, come rising
out of the surf to answer to their names. Each man is
asked by name, &ldquo;How is it with you?&rdquo; and answers with
the deadly sin that has damned him. In Wilkie Collins&rsquo;s
gruesome tale<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> there is one spirit that is unhappy because
his body lies unburied, a recurrence of a theme frequent
in classical stories and Gothic romance, but rare in later
fiction. For the most part the later ghosts are something
more than merely unhappy spirits. They are more positive,
more active, more individualistic, too philosophical to
waste time in useless grieving.</p>

<p>Nor are there many simply happy spirits, perhaps because
the joyous souls are likely to seek their paradise and
forget about the earth. Yet there are instances, such as
the light-hearted spirits of children in various stories, that
with the resilience of childhood shake off gloom and are
gay; Rosamond,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> that comes back to tell her friend how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
happy the other life is, the peacefully content mother,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
and others.</p>

<p>The ghosts that are actively vicious are the most vivid
and numerous in later fiction. The spirits of evil seem to
have a terrible cumulative force, being far more maleficent
than the earlier ones, and more powerful in carrying out
their purposes. Every aspect of supernaturalism seems
to be keyed up to a higher pitch of terror. Evil seems to
have a strangely greater power of immortality over that of
good, judging from the proportion employed in modern
fiction. Has evil so much more strength of will, so much
more permanence of power that it lives on through the
years and centuries, while good deeds perish with the body?
It would appear so from fiction. The ghosts of good
actions do not linger round the abode of the living to any
noticeable extent, but evil deeds are deathless. We have
many stories of places and persons haunted by the embodied
evil of the past, but few by the embodied good.
The revenge ghosts outnumber the grateful dead by legions.</p>

<p>Modern specters have a more complex power than the
old. They are more awful in their import, for they
haunt not merely the body, but the soul. The wicked
spirits will to work dreadful harm to the soul as well as
the body, and drive the victim to spiritual insanity, seeking
to damn him for the life everlasting, making him,
not merely their victim, but through eternity their co-worker
in awful evil. The victim of the vampire, for
instance, who dies as a result of the attack, has to become
in his turn a loathsome vampire to prey on other souls and
bodies. Blackwood&rsquo;s Devil-worshipers seek to kill the
soul as well as the body of their victim. The deathlessness
of evil is shown in Lytton&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and in many of Blackwood&rsquo;s
stories, as where the psychic doctor says to a man,
&ldquo;You are now in touch with certain violent emotions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
passions, purposes, still active in this house, that were
produced in the past by some powerful and evil personality
that lived here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few writers have equaled F. Marion Crawford in the
modern ghost story. His tales have a curdling intensity,
a racking horror that set them far above the ordinary
supernatural fiction. They linger in the mind long after
one has tried in vain to forget them, if indeed one ever does
forget their sense of evil power. There is in each of his
stories an individual horror that marks it as distinct from
its fellows, a power chiefly won by delineation of this
immortality of evil, as in <cite>The Dead Smile</cite>, with its description
of the hideous smile that pollutes the lips of the living
and of the dead. &ldquo;Nurse McDonald said that when Sir
Hugh Ockram smiled, he saw the faces of two women in
hell, two dead women he had betrayed.&rdquo; His vicious
impulses last after death and from his grave he reaches
out to curse his own children, seeking to drive them to
awful, though unconscious sin.</p>

<p>Henry James has drawn for us two characters of unmitigated
evil in Peter Quint and Miss Jessel, who, he says,
are &ldquo;hovering, prowling, blighting presences.&rdquo; They are
agents on whom is laid the dire duty of causing the air to
reek with evil. He says, &ldquo;I recognize that they are not
ghosts at all, as we now know the ghost, but goblins, elves,
imps, demons. The essence of the matter was the villainy
of the motive in the evoked predatory creature.&rdquo; What
he wishes to do in this story is to express a general sense of
spiritual infamy, not specialized, as the hot breath of the
Pit usually confines itself to some one particular psychical
brutality, but as capable of everything, the worst that can
be conceived. How well he has succeeded in his effort,
those who know the story can testify.</p>

<p>Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s stories are in many instances remarkable
examples of this psychic horror. <cite>The Death of Halpin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Frazer</cite> has a touch of almost unbearable dreadfulness.
Frazer is assaulted by an evil spirit in a wood at night
and choked to death, the spirit inhabiting the dead body
of the man&rsquo;s own mother who has idolized him. His dead
mother&rsquo;s face, transfixed with diabolical hate, is thrust
upon him, and the loved hands that have caressed him
strangle him. This is similar to the situation of an evil
spirit occupying the body of a loved dead mother in
<cite>The Mummy&rsquo;s Tale</cite>, by Elliot O&rsquo;Donnell. Bierce&rsquo;s stories
beat upon the mind like bludgeons and his morbid plots
are among the most dreadful in our literature. One
wonders what abnormality of mind conceives such themes,
evolves such situations. If it be true, as Macaulay suggests,
that not only every poet but every person who
appreciates poetry is slightly unbalanced mentally, surely
every writer of such extreme and horrific stories must be
abnormal. There is more than one writer of modern
ghostly fiction of whom it might be said that &ldquo;his soul is
open on the Hell side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another temperament found distinctively in the later
fiction is the humorous ghost. He is a recent development,
and as might be supposed, is characteristically
American. There were a few burlesque ghosts in Elizabethan
drama, the Ghost of Jack,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> for instance, and one
colored ghost that would seem to connote mirth, but the
really humorous specter did not come till later. It
remained for the Yankee to evoke the spook with a sense
of humor. Ghosts are not essentially laughable, and to
make them comic without coarseness or irreverence is an
achievement. Numerous writers have busied their pens
with the funny spook and now we have ghostly laughter
that is mirthful and not horrisonous as in other types.
Specters now laugh with us instead of at us, and instead
of the mocking laughter heard in lonely places we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
&ldquo;heart-easing mirth.&rdquo; Washington Irving evokes several
humorous hoax ghosts, such as the headless horseman
that created excitement in Sleepy Hollow and the serenading
phantom in <cite>The Specter Bridegroom</cite>.</p>

<p>Richard Middleton in his <cite>Ghost Ship</cite> shows some very
informal humorous ghosts. The girls and boys rise from
their graves to flirt over their tombstones on moonlight
nights, and the children play with the village specters as
companions, their favorite being the man that sits on the
wellcurbing with his severed head held in his hands. The
cottagers rebuke the spooks overhead when they grow too
noisy, and a general good-fellowship prevails. Into this
setting the ghost ship sails one night, anchoring itself
in the middle of a turnip patch, and the riotous captain
demoralizes the men of the village, ghosts and all, with his
rum and his jokes. After a stay of some time, one night
in a storm the villagers look out.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Over our heads, sailing very comfortably through the windy
stars, was the ship that had passed the summer in landlord&rsquo;s
field. Her portholes and her windows were ablaze with lights
and there was a noise of singing and fiddling on her decks....
They do say that since then the turnips on landlord&rsquo;s
field have tasted of rum.</p>
</div>

<p>Olive Harper tells<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> of a reporter who is invited by a
cordial spook&mdash;who has been a New York social leader&mdash;to
a spectral banquet and ball underneath Old Trinity. She
satirizes human foibles and weaknesses, showing ghosts
that gossip and gormandize, simper and swear as they did
in life. They learn to play poker, dance, and kill time as
they used to do. Frank R. Stockton has written several
delicious drolleries of supernaturalism, as <cite>The Transferred
Ghost</cite>, where the spook of a living man, the irascible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
uncle of the charming Madeline, terrifies the young suitor
who lacks courage to propose. The audacious and ever-present
ghost swings his feet from the porch railing, invisible
to the girl as inaudible by her, and breaks in on the
conversation in a most disconcerting way. The young
man at last cries out in desperation, &ldquo;What are you waiting
for? I have nothing to say to you?&rdquo; whereat the girl,
who has been undoubtedly waiting to hear the proposal
the embarrassed youth was trying to make, thinks he is
speaking to her and departs in high dudgeon. On a later
occasion the specter comes to announce to him that he has
got his transfer and may be somebody else&rsquo;s ghost instead
of that of the man who was expected to die and didn&rsquo;t,
when the lover cries out, &ldquo;I wish to Heaven you were
mine!&rdquo; And Madeline, melting in a sigh, whispers, &ldquo;I
am yours!&rdquo; The sequel to this is also comic.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Brander Matthews has several stories of humorous supernaturalism,
<cite>Rival Ghosts</cite> being the account of ancestral
spooks belonging to a young bridegroom, and who resent
being brought into enforced companionship by his sudden
elevation to a title, since one ghost must haunt the house
and one the heir. The ingenious groom, at last harassed
to invention by the continual squabbling of the ghosts,
brings about a wedding between them. This is the only
instance I have found of a wedding between two specters,
though there are various cases on record of marriage
between one living and one spectral personage. John
Kendrick Bangs devotes several volumes to the doings
and sayings of spooks, describing parties in a house-boat
on the Styx, where the shades of the departed great gather
together and engage in festivities and discussions, and
showing types of water-ghosts and various kinds of spooks.
The humorous ghost is a more frequent person than one
would suppose without giving some thought to the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for many writers have sharpened their wits on the comic
haunt.</p>

<p>As may be seen from the examples mentioned, the ghost
has made perceptible progress in psychology. The modern
apparition is much more complex in personality than
the crude early type, and shows much more variety.
The up-to-date spook who has a chance to talk things over
with William James, and knows the labyrinths of the human
mind is much better adapted to inflict psychal terrors
than the illiterate specter of the past. He can evolve
mental tortures more subtle and varied than ever, or he
can amuse a downcast mortal by his gambols.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stories of to-day show a decided advance over the
Gothic in the matter of motives for spectral appearance.
There are, it is true, certain motives in common between
them, but the present-day spirit is less limited, for he has
gained the new without loss of the old, if he wishes to keep
the old. The principal impulse that impelled classical
shades to walk the earth was to request burial, since lacking
that he could not enter into the abode of the dead.
This appears frequently also in Gothic romance. It is
shown but little in recent fiction, perhaps because the
modern ghost is reconciled to cremation or is blithely
indifferent to what becomes of his body since it no longer
rules him. <cite>The Queen of Hearts</cite> is one of the few instances
of its use in modern fiction, for it is a vanishing motive
for the most part. Gothic ghosts were also wont to
return to show the hiding-place of treasure, but that,
too, is dying out as an incentive to haunting. The
prosaic explanation here may be that now persons put
their treasure in safety deposits, hence there is scant
occasion for mystery concerning its location after death.
Gothic spooks came back on occasion to reveal parentage,
for parents, like valuables, were frequently mislaid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
terror romance. This is not so important now, since vital
statistics usually keep such matters duly recorded, yet
instances do sometimes occur.</p>

<p>Ghosts in the terror romance came to make requests,
apart from the petition for burial, which tendency is still
observed on the part of later spooks, though not to the
same extent as formerly. The requests are psychologically
interesting, as they usually relate to simple ties of affection,
illustrated by the mother-spirit<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> who asks her friend to
take her children. Gothic spirits came back often to make
revelations concerning the manner of their death, which is
not often the case now, though it does sometimes happen.
And Dickens shows us one ghost returning to influence
the jury that is trying a man for murder. Specters used
to appear to forewarn the living against impending danger,
which impulse is rather lacking in later fiction though it
still occurs. The curious element of futurity enters into
several of these ghostly warnings, as in Dickens&rsquo;s <cite>The
Signal Man</cite> where the apparition presages the man&rsquo;s death,
as in Algernon Blackwood&rsquo;s story<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> is related the incident
of a man who saw the two Indians scalp a white man and
drag his body away, at last crying out, &ldquo;I saw the body,
and <em>the face was my own</em>.&rdquo; Warning spirits of futurity are
seen in <cite>On the Stairs</cite>, where each man beholds his own destiny,&mdash;one
seeing the spectral snake that afterwards kills
him in a hunting expedition, one the ghost of a Zulu, the
savage that almost destroys him some time afterwards,
and the last the ghost of a young woman in a blue dress,
the woman whom he marries and who hounds him to his
death. She presently sees her own fate, too, but what it
is the author does not tell us. One curious incident in the
story is the instantaneous appearance on the stairs of the
woman herself and her ghostly double, one in a white
dress, one in the fatal blue. This sort of spectral warning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
this wireless service for the conveyance of bad news and
hint of threatening danger, serves to link the ghost story
of the present with those of the past. The records of the
Psychical Society show hundreds of such instances, and
much use is made in fiction of plots hinging on such motif.
Scott&rsquo;s White Lady of Avenel appears as a death portent,
as also the &ldquo;Bahr-geist&rdquo; in another novel.</p>

<p>The revenge ghost looms large in fiction as in the drama.
He was the most important figure in Elizabethan as in
classical drama, and Shakespeare&rsquo;s ghosts are principally
of that class. A terrible example of the type is in Robert
Lovell Beddoes&rsquo; <cite>Death&rsquo;s Jest-Book</cite>, that extraordinary example
of dramatic supernaturalism, where the ghost of the
murdered man comes back embodied from the grave and
is an active character to the end of the play. He is summoned
to life through a hideous mistake, the murderer
having asked the magician to call up the spirit of his dead
wife, but the body of his victim having been secretly buried
beside her so that the murderer may have no rest even in
the grave, the awful accusing spirit rises to confront him,
instead of his wife&rsquo;s phantom. The revenge ghost is both
objective and subjective in his manifestation and his
impelling motive adds a touch of frozen horror to his
appearance. He appears in various forms, as dismembered
parts of the body&mdash;illustrated in the stories above
referred to,&mdash;in a horrific invisibility, in a shape of fear
visible only to the guilty, or in a body so objectified as to
seem absolutely real and living to others beside the one
haunted. The apparently casual, idle figure that strolls
about the docks and streets in <cite>The Detective</cite>, seen by
different persons and taken for a man interested only in
his own pursuits, is a revenge ghost so relentless that he
hounds his victim from country to country, at last killing
him by sheer force of terror as he sits on his bed at night,
leaving the imprint of his body on the mattress beside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
dead man whose face is rigid with mad horror. He has
come back in physical embodiment to avenge the betrayal
of his daughter. Ambrose Bierce shows us many spirits
animated by cold and awful revenge, sometimes visible
and sometimes unseen, as where a soldier killed for striking
an officer answers, &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; to the roll-call, just at
which moment a mysterious bullet from nowhere strikes
the officer through the heart.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Crawford sends a drowned
sailor back in wet oil-skins to slay his twin brother who has
impersonated him to win the girl they both loved. When
the two bodies wash ashore one is a newly dead corpse,
the other a skeleton in oil skins; while the dreadful rattle
of the accusing lump of lead in the wife&rsquo;s skull in another
story is a turn of the screw of her horrid revenge. The
revenge ghost in modern fiction is more varied in forms of
manifestation, at times more subtle in suggestion and
ghostly psychology, than the conventionalized type of the
drama and remains one of the most dreadful of the forms
of fear.</p>

<p>In general, the modern stories show a greater intensity
of power in employing the motives that earlier forms had
used as well as far greater range of motivation. The
earlier ghosts were limited in their impulses, and their
psychology was comparatively simple. Not so with the
apparitions of to-day. They have a far wider range of
motives, are moved by more complex impulses and mixed
motivation in many cases difficult to analyze.</p>

<p>The Gothic ghost had some conscience about whom he
haunted. He had too much reserve to force himself
needlessly upon those that had no connection with his
past. If he knew someone that deserved punishment for
wrong done him or his, he tried to haunt him and let
others alone. The modern ghost is not so considerate.
He is actuated in many cases by sheer evil that wreaks itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
upon anyone in range. Death gives a terrible immortality
and access of power to those whose lives have
been particularly evil, and the results are dangerous to
society. Dark discarnate hate manifests itself to those
within reach. Algernon Blackwood would have us believe
that all around us are reservoirs of unspeakable horror and
that any moment of weakness on our part may bring
down the hosts of damnation upon us. This is illustrated
in such stories as <cite>With Intent to Steal</cite>, where the spirit of
a man who has hanged himself comes back with hypnotic
power forcing others to take their lives in the same way,
or in another,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> showing power exerted viciously against
human beings in a certain building, or still another<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
where the witchcraft holds the village in thrall, and elsewhere.
Ambrose Bierce, Bram Stoker, F. Marion Crawford,
and Arthur Machen have written a number of stories
bringing out this side of ghostly psychology, showing the
bands of outlawed spirits that prey on society. There
are spectral bandits and bravos that answer the call of
any force hostile to man, or act of their own accord from
an impulse of malicious mischief.</p>

<p>The jealous ghost is somewhat common of late, showing
that human emotions are carried over into the life beyond.
In various stories we find the dead wife interfering to
prevent a second marriage, or to make life wretched for
the interloper even after the ceremony. But the most
extreme case of jealousy&mdash;even exceeding the instance
of the man whose wife and physician conspired to give him
an overdose to put him out of the way and who is frantic
to prevent their marriage&mdash;is found in Arnold Bennett&rsquo;s
novel, <cite>The Ghost</cite>. Here the spirit of a man who has madly
loved an opera-singer haunts every suitor of hers and
either drives him to abandon his courtship or kills him,
till finally the singer begs the ghost to spare the man she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
loves, which he sadly does, and departs. This is reminiscent
of one of Marie de France&rsquo;s <i lang="br" xml:lang="br">lais</i>.</p>

<p>The varying motives for appearance may be illustrated
by reference to a few ghosts in modern fiction, such as the
woman<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> who comes to drive away a writer&rsquo;s sense of
humor,&mdash;than which there could be no greater spiritual
brutality,&mdash;and set him to writing vile, debased tragedies.
Perhaps she has transferred her attentions to other authors
than the one in the story! Other instances are the little
Gray Ghost in Cornelia A.&nbsp;P. Comer&rsquo;s story by that name,
who impels a stranger to take her child from an orphan
asylum and adopt it, much against his will; the immortal
lovers that haunt a woman who has made a marriage of
convenience&mdash;which has turned out to be a marriage of
inconvenience for her husband<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>; the talkative spook in
Andrew Lang&rsquo;s <cite>In Castle Perilous</cite>, that discourses learnedly
on its own materialization, speaking in technical terms,
pokes fun at Shakespeare for the glow-worm on a winter
night, and the cockcrow in his <cite>Hamlet</cite>, and&mdash;but these are
perhaps enough. If one may judge from ghostly fiction,
death subtracts nothing from human emotion but rather
adds to it, so that the spectral impulses are more poignant
and intense. The darker passions are retained with
cumulative power, and there is a terrible immortality of
hate, of jealousy and revenge.</p>

<p>There is no more impressive revenant than one Coleridge
gives in his <cite>Wanderings of Cain</cite>, the mournful phantom
of Abel appearing to Cain and his little son, Enos.
The child says to his father, &ldquo;I saw a man in unclean
garments and he uttered a sweet voice, full of lamentations.&rdquo;
Cain asks the unhappy spirit, &ldquo;But didst thou
not find favor in the sight of the Lord thy God?&rdquo; to which
the shape answers, &ldquo;The Lord is God of the living only.
The dead have another God!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Cain ran after the shape and the shape fled shrieking
over the sands, and the sands rose like white mists behind
the steps of Cain but the feet of him that was like Abel disturbed
not the sands.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most interesting phases of comparative
ghost-lore is the study of the intricate personality of
specters. With respect to dual personality the late
supernatural stories are curiously reminiscent of the
animistic belief that a ghost is a double of the mortal, a
vapory projection of his actual body, to be detached at
will during life and permanently at death. I do not know
of any instances of doubles in classical literature, nor is
the idea used in Gothic romance. Likewise Shakespeare&rsquo;s
ghosts are all spirits of persons safely dead. It remained
for the modern writer with his expertness in psychology
and psychiatry to evoke the ghosts of the living persons,
the strange cases of dual personality and of separate personalities
supernaturally merged into one, and those inexplicable
ghosts of subliminal memories. All these forms
appear in elusive analysis, in complex suggestiveness,
in modern uncanny stories, and constitute one of the distinct
marks of advance over the earlier types.</p>

<p>The double, a frequent figure in English fiction, bears
a resemblance to the Doppelgänger of German folk-tales.
Numerous examples of dual personality, of one being
appearing in two forms, are seen, with different twists
to the idea, yet much alike. It has been suggested that
these stories have their germinal origin in Calderon&rsquo;s
play,<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> where a man is haunted by himself. Poe&rsquo;s <cite>William
Wilson</cite> is a tense and tragic story of a man pursued by
his double, till in desperation he kills him, only to realize
that he has slain his better self, his conscience. His
duplicate cries out, &ldquo;Henceforward thou art also dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
dead to the world, to Heaven and to hope! In me thou
didst exist and in my death, see by this thine image, which
is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself!&rdquo;
Stevenson&rsquo;s <cite>Markheim</cite> shows in the person of the stranger
the incarnate conscience, an embodiment of a man&rsquo;s
nobler self that leads him through the labyrinth of self-examination
to the knowledge of the soul&rsquo;s truth. The
stranger tests the murderer by offering him a way of
escape, by suggesting further crime to him, by showing
him relentlessly what the consequence of each act will be,
till in despair Markheim, realizing that his life is hopelessly
weak and involved, decides to surrender it rather
than to sin further. Step by step the nameless visitor
leads him, Markheim shuddering back from the evil that
is suggested, thinking the stranger is a demonic tempter,
till at last the transfigured face shows him to be the nobler
angel. Stevenson&rsquo;s <cite>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</cite> is, of course,
the best-known instance of this sort of dual personality,
this walking forth in physical form of the evil in one&rsquo;s
own nature, with a separate existence of its own. No
writer could hope to express this idea more powerfully
than has been done in this chemical allegory, this biological
dissection of the soul. The thrill of suspense, the seemingly
inexplicable mystery, the dramatic tenseness of the
closing scenes make this sermon in story form unforgettable.
Kipling has given a striking story of a man haunted
by his own phantom body, in <cite>At the End of the Passage</cite>.
His own figure slipped silently before him as he went
through his lonely house. &ldquo;When he came in to dinner
he found himself seated at the table. The vision rose and
walked out hastily. Except that it cast no shadow it was
in all respects real.&rdquo; The horror of this haunting specter
of himself, this double of his own body and soul, drives
the man to suicide, after which a peculiar twist of horror
is given by the detail at the close, of the discovery by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
comrade, of the man&rsquo;s own photograph imprinted on the
dead retina and reproduced by the camera hours after his
death. In Julian Hawthorne&rsquo;s allegory,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> the dead man&rsquo;s
spirit meets the devil, who is his own evil self incarnate.</p>

<p>Edith Wharton&rsquo;s <cite>Triumph of Night</cite> reveals a ghost of a
living man standing behind his double&rsquo;s chair, visible to
the person opposite and showing on the ghostly face the
evil impulses that the living countenance cleverly masks.
John Kendrick Bangs has his hero say,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> &ldquo;I came face to
face with myself, with that other self in which I recognized,
developed to the fullest extent, every bit of my capacity
for an evil life,&rdquo; and Blackwood<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> relates the meeting of a
musician and his ghostly double in an opera hall. Mr.
Titbottom,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> through the power of his magic spectacles
reflecting his image in a mirror, sees himself as he really is,
as he looks to God, and flees horror-stricken from the
sight. This symbolic representation is akin to the <cite>Prophetic
Pictures</cite> of Hawthorne, where a woman&rsquo;s griefs and
marks of age are shown in her pictured face before they
are revealed in her actual experience, a pictured futurity.
The most impressive instance of this relation between a
human being and his portrait is in Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <cite>Picture
of Dorian Gray</cite>, that strange study of a man&rsquo;s real nature
expressing itself on his painted likeness, while the living
face bears no mark of sin or shame or age, until the tragic
revelation at the end. Edith Wharton<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> also represents a
supernatural dualism, the woman&rsquo;s statue showing on its
marble face the changing horror of her own stricken
countenance. <cite>The White Sleep of Auber Hurn</cite> is a curious
story of a spiritual double, a psychological study of a man
who was in two places at once, seen by various persons who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
knew him in each case, being killed in a train wreck many
miles away from his room where he was lying asleep in his
bed,&mdash;a sleep that knows no waking.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Distinct from the expression of one personality in two
bodies, the supernatural merging of two separate personalities
into one appears in recent ghostly fiction. It forms
a subtle psychologic study and is uncannily effective.
H.&nbsp;G. Wells&rsquo;s <cite>Story of the Late Mr. Elvesham</cite> is a peculiar
narrative of a transfer of personality as the result of a
mysterious drink, by which an old man takes possession
of a young man&rsquo;s body, leaving the youth to inhabit the
worn-out shell of the dotard. Algernon Blackwood in
<cite>The Terror of the Twins</cite> describes a supernatural merging
of two natures into one by the power of a dead father&rsquo;s
insane curse. The younger son loses his vitality, his
mind, his personality, all of which is supermortally given
to his older brother, while the deprived son dies a drivelling
idiot of sheer inertia and utter absence of vital
power. Mary Heaton Vorse<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> describes a neurotic woman
who comes back from the grave to obsess and possess the
interloper in her home, through the immortal force of her
jealousy, making the living woman actually become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
reincarnation of the dead wife. This story naturally
suggests Poe&rsquo;s <cite>Ligeia</cite> which is the climax of ghostly horror
of this motif, with its thesis that &ldquo;man doth not yield
himself to the angels nor unto death utterly save through
the weakness of his own feeble will&rdquo; expressed in a terrible
crescendo of ghastly horror. Poe&rsquo;s <cite>Morella</cite> is a similar
study of the supernatural merging of an exterior personality
into a living body, where the dead mother and
her child are literally one flesh and one spirit. Blackwood&rsquo;s
<cite>The Return</cite> is an example of the compact-ghost,
that comes back at the hour of death to reveal himself to
his friend as he long ago promised he would. The dead
artist manifests himself through a sudden and wonderful
realization of the beauty of the world to which the materialistic
friend has heretofore been blinded and indifferent.
Feeling this sudden rapturous sweep of beauty through
his soul, the living man knows that his artist friend is
dead and that his spirit has become a part of his own
being. In the same manner the little lonely soul in
Granville Barker&rsquo;s wonderful piece of symbolism, <cite>Souls
on Fifth</cite>, enters into the being of the man who has the
understanding heart and continues her existence as a part
of him.</p>

<p>An essentially modern type of ghost story is that which
has its explanation on the basis of subliminal memories.
It seems that all around us are reservoirs of ancestral
memories, records of the vital thoughts and actions of the
long dead, psychical incarnations of their supreme
moments, their striking hours, into which the living at
times stumble and are submerged. Some slight spiritual
accident may bring down upon mortals the poignant
suffering and bliss of the dead in whose personality they
are curiously duplicated. These ghosts of dead selves
from the past are different from the doubles that are
projections of the living, or prophetic specters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
future, and are clearly distinguished. <cite>The Borderland</cite>,
by Francis Parsons, tells of a young army officer who is
obsessed by subliminal self, the ghost of his grandfather.
He feels that he <em>is</em> his grandfather, living another existence,
yet he lacks the pluck, the manhood, that the old pioneer
possessed. At a crisis in his military affairs, the old
frontiersman comes visibly forward to give him the
courage that is needed, after which he manifests himself
no more. The scene of this subliminal haunting is a
Texas prairie, during a border fight, rather an unghostly
setting yet one which makes the supernatural seem more
actual. Arthur Johnson<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> presents the case of a man who
sees the ghosts of ancestral memory in a vivid form. He
sees and hears his own double wildly accuse his wife&mdash;who
is the double of his own&mdash;betrothed, after having
killed her lover. His hand is wounded and the fingers
leave bloodstains as they snatch at the gray chiffon
round his wife&rsquo;s throat. After a fit of unconsciousness
into which he falls is over, the modern man awakes to
find his hand strangely wounded, and on the floor of the
upper room he picks up a scrap of bloodstained gray
chiffon! Blackwood&rsquo;s <cite>Old Clothes</cite> shows a little girl
obsessed by subliminal memories. She is haunted by
terrible experiences in which she says that she and some
of those around her have been concerned. She goes into
convulsions if anything is fastened around her waist, and
she cries out that some cruel man has shut her up in the
wall to die and has cut off Philip&rsquo;s hands so that he cannot
save her. Investigations bring to light the facts that a
long-dead ancestress, living in the same house, had been
walled up alive by her husband after he had cut off her
lover&rsquo;s hands before her face. The skeleton is found
chained by the waist inside the ancient wall. Blackwood&rsquo;s
<cite>Ancient Sorceries</cite> depicts the ghosts of buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
life, of a whole village enchanted by the past and living
over again the witchcraft of the long ago. As John Silence,
the psychic doctor, tells of the Englishman who drops
casually into the village and is drawn into the magic:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Vesin was swept into the vortex of forces arising out of the
intense activities of a past life and lived over again a scene
in which he had often played a part centuries ago. For
strong actions set up forces that are so slow to exhaust themselves
that they may be said in a sense never to die. In this
case they were not complete enough to render the illusion
perfect, so the little man was confused between the present
and the past.</p>
</div>

<p>That story of unusual psychical experience, <cite>An Adventure</cite>,
by two Oxford women, can be explained on no
other basis than some such theory as this. The book
claims to be a truthful account of a happening at Versailles,
where two English women, teachers and daughters of
clergymen, saw in broad daylight the ghosts of the past,
the figures of Marie Antoinette and her court. The writers
offer the explanation that they stumbled into a sort
of pocket of the unhappy queen&rsquo;s memories and saw the
past relived before their eyes because she had felt it so
keenly and vividly long ago. Other instances might be
given, but these are sufficient to illustrate the type.
Such stories have a curious haunting power and are
among the most effective narratives. The idea is modern
and illustrates the complexity of later thought as compared
with the simplicity of earlier times.</p>

<p>A comparative study of ghost stories leads one to the
conclusion that the ghost is the most modern of ancients
and the most ancient of moderns. In some respects the
present specter is like and in some unlike the previous
forms. Ghosts, whether regarded as conjective or purely
subjective, are closely related to the percipients&rsquo; thoughts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Primitive times produced a primitive supernaturalism
and the gradual advance in intellectual development
has brought about a heightening and complexity of the
weird story. &rsquo;Tis in ourselves that ghosts are thus and
so!</p>

<p>The spook of to-day is of a higher nervous organization
than his forbears. In many instances the latter-day
ghost is so distracted by circumstances that he hardly
knows where he&rsquo;s at, as for instance, the ghost in such case
as <cite>The Tryst</cite>, by Alice Brown, where a man is thought to
be drowned and his ghost comes out to comfort his
sweetheart, only to have the drowned man brought back
to life presently; and in <cite>The Woman from Yonder</cite>, by
Stephen French Whitman, where a scientist with impertinent
zeal brings life back to the body of a woman who
had bled to death while Hannibal was crossing the Alps
and been buried in a glacier till the glacier spat her out.
Now, what was the status of those ghosts? Was there a
ghost if the person wasn&rsquo;t really dead? But if a woman
isn&rsquo;t dead after she has been in an ice-pack for two
thousand years or thereabouts what surety is there for the
standing of any ghost?</p>

<p>The apparitions of to-day have more lines of interest
than the ancient ghosts. The Gothic specter was a one-idea
creature, with a single-track brain. He was not a
ghost-of-all-work as are some of the later spooks. He was
a simple-souled being who felt a call to haunt somebody
for some purpose or other, so he just went and did it.
The specters of to-day are more versatile,&mdash;they can turn
their hand to any kind of haunting that is desired and
show an admirable power of adaptability, though there
are highly developed specialists as well. The psychology
of the primitive ghost and of the Gothic specter was
simple. They knew only the elemental passions of love
and hate. Gothic spooks haunted the villain or villainess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to foil them in their wicked designs or punish them for
past misdeeds, or hovered over the hero or heroine to
advise, comfort, and chaperon them. But the modern
ghosts are not satisfied with such sit-by-the-fire jobs as
these. They like to keep in the van of activity and do
what mortals do. They run the whole scale of human
motions and emotions and one needs as much handy
psychology to interpret their hauntings as to read George
Meredith. They are actuated by subtle motivations of
jealousy, ardent love, tempered friendship, curiosity,
mischief, vindictiveness, revenge, hate, gratitude, and all
other conceivable impulses. The Billy Sunday sort of
ghost who wants to convert the world, the philanthropic
spirit who wants to help humanity, the socialist specter
that reads the magazine, the friendly visitor that sends its
hands back to wash the dishes, the little shepherd lad that
returns to tend the sheep, are among the new concepts in
fiction of the supernatural. The ghost of awful malice, to
be explained only on the basis of compound interest of
evil stored up for many years, is a new force.</p>

<p>Though the ghostly narrative has shifted its center of
gravity from the novel to the short story since Gothic
times, and many more of the modern instances are in that
form, the supernatural novel has recently taken on a new
lease of life. Honors are almost even between the English
and the American ghost story, as most of the representative
writers on each side turn their pen at some time to
write terror tales. The ghost has never lost his power over
the human mind. Judging from the past, one may say
that the popularity of the ghost story will continue
undiminished and will perhaps increase. Certainly there
has been a new influx of stories within later times. What
mines of horror yet remain untouched for writers of the
future, it would be hard to say, yet we do not fear for the
exhaustion of the type. On the contrary, ghosts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
fiction are becoming so numerous that one wonders if the
Malthusian theory will not in time affect them. We are
too fond of being fooled by phantoms to surrender them,
for &ldquo;the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out the
spine&rdquo; is an awesome joy. For ourselves, we are content
for the present to function on one plane, but we love to
adventure on another plane through spectral substitutes.
We may give up the mortal but we&rsquo;ll not willingly give
up the ghost. We love him. We believe in him. Our attitude
towards specters is much like that of the little black
boy that Ellis Parker Butler tells about in <cite>Dey Ain&rsquo;t No
Ghosts</cite>, who sees a terrifying array of &ldquo;all de sperits in de
world, an&rsquo; all de ha&rsquo;nt in de world, an&rsquo; all de hobgoblins
in de world, an&rsquo; all spicters in de world, an&rsquo; all de ghostes
in de world,&rdquo; come out to bring a fearsome message to a
frightened pickaninny.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="stl">The Devil and His Allies</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Ghosts</span> are few but devils are plenty,&rdquo; said Cotton
Mather, but his saying would need to be inverted
to fit present-day English fiction. Now we have
ghosts in abundance but devils are scarce. In fact, they
bid fair to become extinct in our romances, at least in
the form that is easily recognizable. Satan will probably
soon be in solution, identified merely as a state of mind.
He has been so Burbanked of late, with his dæmonic
characteristics removed and humanities added that, save
for sporadic reversion to type, the old familiar demon
is almost a vanished form. The modern mind seems to
cling with a new fondness to the ghost but has turned the
cold shoulder to the devil, perhaps because many modernists
believe more in the human and less in the supernatural&mdash;and
after all, ghosts are human and devils are not.
The demon has disported himself in various forms in
literature, from the scarlet fiend of monkish legend, the
nimble imp and titanic nature-devil of folk-lore to Milton&rsquo;s
epic, majestic Satan, and Goethe&rsquo;s mocking Mephistopheles,
passing into allegoric, symbolic, and satiric
figures in later fiction. He has been an impressive character
in the drama, the epic, the novel, in poetry, and the
short story. We have seen him as a loathly, brutish
demon in Dante, as a superman, as an intellectual satirist,
and as a human being appealing to our sympathy. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
has gradually lost his epic qualities and become human.
He is not present in literature now to the extent to which
he was known in the past, is not so impressive a figure as
heretofore, and at times when he does appear his personality
is so ambiguously set forth that it requires close
literary analysis to prove his presence.</p>

<p>In this chapter the devil will be discussed with reference
to his appearances on earth, while in a later division he
will be seen in his own home. It would be hard to say
with certainty when and where the devil originated, yet
he undoubtedly belongs to one of our first families and is
said to have been born theologically in Persia about the
year 900 <span class="f8">B.C.</span> He has appeared under various aliases, as
Ahriman of the Zoroastrian system, Pluto in classical
mythology, Satan, Beelzebub, Prince of Darkness, and by
many other titles. In his <cite>Address to the De&rsquo;il</cite> Burns
invokes him thus:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Oh, Thou! whatever title suit thee,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Auld Hornie, Satan, Nick or Cloutie!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">He has manifested himself in fiction under diverse names,
as Demon, Lucifer, Satan, Mephistopheles, Prince Lucio,
The Man in Black, and so forth, but whatever the name he
answers to, he is known in every land and has with
astonishing adaptability made himself at home in every
literature.</p>

<p>The devil has so changed his form and his manner of
appearance in later literature that it is hard to identify
him as his ancient self. In early stories he was heralded
by supernatural thunder and lightning and accompanied
by a strong smell of sulphur. He dressed in character
costume, sometimes in red, sometimes in black, but always
indubitably diabolic. He wore horns, a forked tail, and
cloven hoofs and was a generally unprepossessing creature
whom anyone could know for a devil. Now his rôle is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
not so typical and his garb not so declarative. He wears
an evening suit, a scholar&rsquo;s gown, a parson&rsquo;s robe, a
hunting coat, with equal ease, and it is sometimes difficult
to tell the devil from the hero of a modern story. He has
been deodorized and no longer reeks warningly of the Pit.</p>

<p>The mediæval mind conceived of the devil as a sort of
combination of mythologic satyr and religious dragon.
It is interesting to note how the pagan devil-myths have
been engrafted upon the ideas of Christianity, to fade out
very slowly and by degrees. In monkish legends the devil
was an energetic person who would hang round a likely
soul for years, if need be, on the chance of nabbing him.
Many monkish legends have come down to us.</p>

<p>The diabolic element in English folk-lore shows a rich
field for study. The devil here as in the monkish legendry
appears as an enemy of souls, a tireless tempter. He lies
in wait for any unwary utterance, and the least mention
of his name, any thoughtless expletive, such as &ldquo;The devil
take me if&mdash;&rdquo; brings instant response from him to clinch
the bargain. Yet the devil of rustic folk-lore is of a
bucolic dullness, less clever than in any phase of literature,
more gullible, more easily imposed on. English folk-lore,
especially the Celtic branches, shows the devil as very
closely related to nature. He was wont to work off his
surplus energy or his wrath by disturbing the landscape,
and many stories of his prankish pique have come down
to us. If anything vexed him he might stamp so hard
upon a plain that the print of his cloven hoof would be
imprinted permanently. He was fond of drinking out of
pure springs and leaving them cursed with sulphur, and
he sometimes showed annoyance by biting a section out
of a mountain, Devil&rsquo;s Bit Mountain in Ireland being
one of the instances. In general, any peculiarity of
nature might be attributed to the activities of Auld
Hornie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The devil has always been a pushing, forward sort of
person, so he was not content with being handed round by
word of mouth in monkish legend or rustic folk-lore, but
must worm his way into literature in general. Since then
many ink-pots have been emptied upon him besides the
one that Luther hurled against his cloister wall. The devil
is seen frequently in the miracle plays, showing grotesquerie,
the beginnings of that sardonic humor he is to
display in more important works later. In his appearance
in literature the devil is largely anthropomorphic. Man
creates the devil in his own image, one who is not merely
personal but racial as well, reflecting his creator. In
monkish tradition an adversary in wait for souls, in rustic
folk-lore a rollicking buffoon with waggish pranks, in
miracle plays reflecting the mingled seriousness and comic
elements of popular beliefs, he mirrors his maker. But it
is in the great poems and dramas and stories that we find
the more personal aspects of devil-production, and it is
these epic and dramatic concepts of the devil that have
greatly influenced modern fiction. While the Gothic
romance was but lightly touched by the epic supernaturalism,
the literature since that time has reflected it
more, and the Satanic characters of Dante, Milton,
Calderon, Marlowe, and Goethe have cast long shadows
over modern fiction. The recent revival of interest in
Dante has doubtless had its effect here.</p>

<p>Burns in his <cite>Address to the De&rsquo;il</cite> shows his own kindly
heart and honest though ofttimes misdirected impulses
by suggesting that there is still hope for the devil to repent
and trusting that he may do so yet. Mrs. Browning, in
her <cite>Drama of Exile</cite>, likewise shows in Lucifer some appeal
to our sympathies, reflecting the pitying heart of the
writer,&mdash;showing a certain kinship to Milton&rsquo;s Satan yet
with weakened intellectual power. She makes Gabriel
say to him:</p>

<p class="noi">Byron&rsquo;s devil in <cite>A Vision of Judgment</cite> is, like Caliban&rsquo;s
ideas of Setebos, &ldquo;altogether such an one&rdquo; as Byron
conceived himself to be. He is a terrible figure, whose</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>He shows diabolical sarcasm when he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kings
enough below, God knows!&rdquo; And how like Oscar Wilde
is the devil he pictures to us in his symbolic story, <cite>The
Fisherman and his Soul</cite>. The prince of darkness who
appears to the young fisherman that wishes to sell his
soul to the devil is &ldquo;a man dressed in a suit of black velvet
cut in Spanish fashion. His proud face was strangely
pale, but his lips were like a proud red flower. He seemed
weary and was leaning back toying in a listless manner
with the pommel of his saddle.&rdquo; When the fisherman
unthoughtedly utters a prayer that baffles the fiend for
the time, the demon mounts his jennet with the silver harness
and rides away, still with the proud, disdainful face,
sad with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> weariness unlike the usual alertness of
the devil. He has a sort of Blessed Damozel droop to
his figure, and the bored patience of a lone man at an
afternoon tea. Wilde shows us some little mocking red
devils in another of his stories,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and <cite>The Picture of Dorian
Gray</cite> is a concept of diabolism.</p>

<p>Scott in <cite>The Talisman</cite> puts a story of descent from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Evil One in the mouth of the Saracen, the legend of the
spirits of evil who formed a league with the cruel Zohauk,
by which he gained a daily sacrifice of blood to feed two
hideous serpents that had become a part of himself.
One day seven sisters of wonderful beauty are brought,
whose loveliness appeals to the immortals. In the midst
of supernatural manifestations the earth is rent and seven
young men appear. The leader says to the eldest sister:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I am Cothreb, king of the subterranean world. I and my
brethren are of those who, created out of elementary fire,
disdained even at the command of Omnipotence, to do homage
to a clod of earth because it is called man. Thou mayest
have heard of us as cruel, unrelenting, and persecuting. It is
false. We are by nature kind and generous, vengeful only
when insulted, cruel only when affronted. We are true to those
that trust us; and we have heard the invocations of thy
father the sage Mithrasp, who wisely worships not only the
Origin of Good, but that which is called the Source of Evil.
You and your sisters are on the eve of death; but let each give
to us one hair from your fair tresses in token of fealty, and we
will carry you many miles to a place of safety where you may
bid defiance to Zohauk and his ministers.</p>
</div>

<p>The maidens accept the offer and become the brides of
the spirits of evil.</p>

<p>The devil in Scott&rsquo;s <cite>Wandering Willie&rsquo;s Tale</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> also
speaks a good word for himself. When the gudesire
meets in the woods the stranger who sympathizes with
his obvious distress, the unknown offers to help him,
saying, &ldquo;If you will tell me your grief, I am one that,
though I have been sair miscaa&rsquo;d in the world, am the
only hand for helping my freends.&rdquo; The gudesire tells his
woes and says that he would go to the gates of hell, and
farther, to get the receipt due him, upon which the hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
stranger conducts him to the place mentioned. The
canny Scot obtains the document, outwits the devil, and
wins his way back to earth unscathed.</p>

<p>One marked aspect of recent devil-fiction is the tendency
to gloze over his sins and to humanize him. This is
shown to a marked degree in Marie Corelli&rsquo;s sentimental
novel, <cite>The Sorrows of Satan</cite>, where she expends much
anxious sympathy over the fiend. To Miss Corelli&rsquo;s
agitated mind Satan is a much maligned martyr who
regretfully tempts mortals and is grieved when they yield
to his beguilements. Her perfervid rhetoric pictures him
as a charming prince, handsome, wealthy, yet very lonesome,
who warns persons in advance that he is not what
he seems and that they would do well to avoid him. But
the fools rush in crowds to be damned. According to her
theory, the devil is attempting to work out his own salvation
and could do so save for the weakness of man. He is
able to get a notch nearer heaven for every soul that resists
his wiles, though in London circles his progress is backward
rather than forward. How is Lucifer fallen! To be
made a hero of by Marie Corelli must seem to Mephisto
life&rsquo;s final indignity! Her characterization of the fiend
shows some reminiscence of a hasty reading of Milton,
Goethe, and the Byronic Cain.</p>

<p>The devil has a human as well as dæmonic spirit in
Israel Zangwill&rsquo;s <cite>They that Walk in Darkness</cite>, where he
appears as Satan Maketrig, a red-haired hunchback, with
&ldquo;gigantic marble brow, cold, keen, steely eyes, and handsome,
clean-shaven lips.&rdquo; He seems a normal human
being in this realistic Ghetto setting, though he bears a
nameless sense of evil about with him. In his presence,
or as he passes by, all the latent evil in men&rsquo;s souls comes
to the surface. He lures the rabbi away from his wife,
from God, and from all virtue, yet to see him at the end
turn away again in spirit to the good, spurning the tempter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
whom he recognizes at last as dæmonic. There is a human
anguish in the eyes of Satan Maketrig, that shows him to
be not altogether diabolic, and he seems mournful and
appealing in his wild loneliness. His nature is in contrast
to that of the fiend in Stanley J. Weyman&rsquo;s <cite>The Man in
Black</cite>. Here his cold, sardonic jesting that causes him to
play with life and death, so lightly, his diabolic cunning,
his knowledge of the human heart and how to torture it,
remind us of Iago. The dark shade extends to the skin as
well as to the heart in the man in black in Stevenson&rsquo;s
<cite>Thrawn Janet</cite>, for he exercises a weird power over his
vassal, the old servant, and terrifies even the minister.
And <cite>War Letters from a Living Dead Man</cite>, written by
Elsa Parker but said to be dictated by a correspondent
presumably from somewhere in hell, shows us His Satanic
Majesty with grim realism up to date.</p>

<p>The devil appears with mournful, human dignity, yet
with superhuman gigantism in Algernon Blackwood&rsquo;s
<cite>Secret Worship</cite>, where the lost souls enter into a riot of
devil-worship, into which they seek to draw living victims,
to damn them body and soul. One victim sees the devil
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>At the end of the room where the windows seemed to have
disappeared so that he could see the stars, there rose up into
view, far against the sky, grand and terrible, the outline of a
man. A kind of gray glory enveloped him so that it resembled
a steel-cased statue, immense, imposing, horrific
in its distant splendor. The gray radiance from its mightily
broken visage, august and mournful, beat down upon his soul,
pulsing like some dark star with the powers of spiritual evil.</p>
</div>

<p>Here, as in many instances elsewhere, the sadness of
the diabolic character is emphasized, a definite human
element. The Miltonic influence seems evident in such
cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Kipling has a curious dæmonic study in <cite>Bubble Well Road</cite>,
a story of a patch of ground filled with devils and ghosts
controlled by an evil-minded native priest, while in
<cite>Haunted Subalterns</cite> the imps terrorize young army officers
by their malicious mischief.</p>

<p>The allegorical and symbolic studies of diabolism are
among the more impressive creations in later fiction, as in
Tolstoi&rsquo;s <cite>Ivan, the Fool</cite>, where the demons are responsible
for the marshaling of armies, the tyranny of money, and
the inverted ideas of the value of service. The appearance
of the devil in later stories is more terrible and effective
in its variance of type and its secret symbolism than
the crude enginery of diabolism in Gothic fiction, as the
muscular fiend<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> that athletically hurls the man and woman
from the mountain top, or the invisible physical strength
manifested in <cite>Melmoth, the Wanderer</cite>. The crude violence
of these novels is in keeping with the fiction of the time,
yet modern stories show a distinct advance, as such
instances as J.&nbsp;H. Shorthouse&rsquo;s <cite>Countess Eve</cite>, where the
devil appears differently to each tempted soul, embodying
with hideous wisdom the form of the sin that that particular
soul is most liable to commit. He bears the shape of
committed sin, suggesting that evil is so powerful as to
have an independent existence of its own, apart from the
mind that gave it birth, as the devil appears as evil thought
materialized in Fernac Molnar&rsquo;s drama, <cite>The Devil</cite>. Fiona
McLeod&rsquo;s strange Gaelic tale, <cite>The Sin-Eater</cite> introduces
demons symbolically. The sin-eater is a person that
by an ancient formula can remove the sins from an
unburied corpse and let them in turn be swept away from
him by the action of the pure air. But if the sin-eater
hates the dead man, he has the power to fling the transgressions
into the sea, to turn them into demons that
pursue and torment the flying soul till Judgment Day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>One aspect of the recent stories of diabolism is the
subtleness by which the evil is suggested. The reader
feels a miasmatic atmosphere of evil, a smear on the soul,
and knows that certain incidents in the action can be
accounted for on no other basis than that of dæmonic
presence, as in Barry Pain&rsquo;s <cite>Moon Madness</cite>, where the
princess is moved by a strange irresistible lure to dance
alone night after night in the heart of the secret labyrinth
to mystic music that the white moon makes. But one
night, after she is dizzy and exhausted but impelled to keep
on, she feels a hot hand grasp hers; someone whirls her
madly round and she knows that <em>she is not dancing alone</em>!
She is seen no more of men, and searchers find only the
prints of her little dancing slippers in the sand, with the
mark of a cloven hoof beside them. The most revolting
instances of suggestive diabolism are found in Arthur
Machen&rsquo;s stories, where supernatural science opens the
way for the devil to enter the human soul, since the
biologist by a cunning operation on the brain removes
the moral sense, takes away the soul, and leaves a being
absolutely diabolized. Worse still is the hideousness of
<cite>Seeing the Great God Pan</cite>, where the dæmonic character is
a composite of the loathsome aspects of Pan and the devil,
from which horrible paternity is born a child that embodies
all the unspeakable evil in the world.</p>

<p>In pleasant contrast to dreadful stories are the tales of
the amusing devils that we find frequently. The comic
devil is much older than the comic ghost, as authors
showed a levity toward demons long before they treated
the specter with disrespect,&mdash;one rather wonders why.
Clownish devils that appeared in the miracle plays
prepared the way for the humorous and satiric treatment
of the Elizabethan drama and late fiction. The liturgical
imps were usually funny whether their authors intended
them as such or not, but the devils in fiction are quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
conscious of their own wit, in fact, are rather conceited
about it. Poe shows us several amusing demons who
display his curious satiric humor,&mdash;for instance, the old
gentleman in <cite>Never Bet the Devil your Head</cite>. When
Toby Dammit makes his rash assertion, he beholds</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect.
Nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance;
for he not only had on a full suit of black, but his shirt was
perfectly clean and the collar turned down very neatly over a
white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl&rsquo;s.
His hands were clasped pensively over his stomach, and his
two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.</p>
</div>

<p>This clerical personage who reminds us of the devil in
<cite>Peer Gynt</cite>, who also appears as a parson, claims the better&rsquo;s
head and neatly carries it off. This is a modern version of
an incident similar to Chaucer&rsquo;s <cite>Friar&rsquo;s Tale</cite>, where the
devil claimed whatever was offered him in sincerity.
The combination of humor and mystery in Washington
Irving&rsquo;s <cite>The Devil and Tom Walker</cite> shows the black
woodsman in an amusing though terrifying aspect, as he
claims the keeping of the contracts made with him by
Tom and his miserly wife. When Tom goes to search for
his spouse in the woods, he fails to find her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>She had probably attempted to deal with the black man as
she had been accustomed to deal with her husband; but
though the female scold is generally considered a match for
the devil, yet in this instance she appears to have had the
worst of it. She must have died game, however, for it is said
Tom noticed many prints of cloven feet deeply stamped
about the tree, and found handsful of hair that looked as if
they had been plucked from the coarse shock of the black
woodsman. Tom knew his wife&rsquo;s prowess by experience. He
shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the fierce signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
clapper-clawing. &ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;Old Scratch
must have had a tough time of it!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The devil amuses himself in various ways, as is seen by
the antics of the mysterious stranger in Poe&rsquo;s <cite>The Devil in
the Belfry</cite>, who comes curvetting into the old Dutch
village with his audacious and sinister face and curious
costume, to upset the sacred time of the place. The
visitant in <cite>Bon Bon</cite> is likewise queer as to dress and habits.
He wears garments in the style of a century before, having
a queue but no shirt, a cravat with an ecclesiastic suggestion,
also a stylus and black book. His facial expression
is such as would have struck Uriah Heap dumb with
envy, and the hint of hoofs and a forked tail is cleverly
given though not obtruded. The most remarkable
feature of his appearance, however, is that he has no eyes,
simply a dead level of flesh. He declares that he eats
souls and prefers to buy them alive to insure freshness. He
has a taste for philosophers, when they are not too tough.</p>

<p>The satiric devil, like the satiric ghost, is seen in modern
fiction. Eugene Field has a story of a demon who seems
sympathetic, weeping large, gummy tears at hearing a
mortal&rsquo;s woes, and signing the conventional contract on a
piece of asbestos paper. He agrees to do everything the
man wishes, for a certain term of years, in return for which
he is to get the soul. If the devil forfeits the contract, he
loses not only that victim but the souls of two thousand
already in his clutches. The man shrewdly demands
trying things of him, but the demon is game, building and
endowing churches, carrying on philanthropic and reform
work without complaint, but balking when the man asks
him to close the saloons on Sunday. Rather than do
that, he releases the two thousand and one souls and flies
away twitching his tail in wrath.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The most recent, as perhaps the most striking, instance
of the satiric devil is in Mark Twain&rsquo;s posthumous novel,
<cite>The Mysterious Stranger</cite>. A youth, charming, courtly,
and handsome appears in a medieval village, confessing
to two boys that he is Satan, though not the original of
that name, but his nephew and namesake. He insists
that he is an unfallen angel, since his uncle is the only
member of his family that has sinned. Satan reads the
thoughts of mortals, kindles fire in his pipe by breathing
on it, supplies money and other desirable things by mere
suggestion, is invisible when he wills it so, and is generally
a gifted being. This perennial boy&mdash;only sixteen thousand
years old&mdash;makes a charming companion. He says to
Marget that his papa is in shattered health and has no
property to speak of,&mdash;in fact, none of any earthly value,&mdash;but
he has an uncle in business down in the tropics, who
is very well off, and has a monopoly, and it is from this
uncle that he drew his support. Marget expresses the
hope that her uncle and his would meet some day, and
Satan says he hoped so, too. &ldquo;May be they will,&rdquo; says
Marget. &ldquo;Does your uncle travel much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he goes all about,&mdash;he has business everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The book is full of this oblique humor, satirizing earth,
heaven, and hell. The stranger by his comments on
theological creeds satirizes religion, and Satan is an intended
parody of God. He sneers at man&rsquo;s &ldquo;mongrel
moral sense,&rdquo; which tells him the distinction between good
and evil, insisting that he should have no choice, that the
right to choose makes him inevitably choose the wrong.
He makes little figures out of clay and gives them life,
only to destroy them with casual ruthlessness a little
later and send them to hell. In answer to the old servant&rsquo;s
faith in God, when she says that He will care for her and
her mistress, since &ldquo;not a sparrow falleth to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
without His Knowledge,&rdquo; he sneers, &ldquo;But it falls, just
the same! What&rsquo;s the good of seeing it fall?&rdquo; He is a
new diabolic figure, yet showing the composite traits of the
old, the dæmonic wisdom and sarcasm, the superhuman
magnetism to draw men to him, and the human qualities
of geniality, sympathy, and boyish charm.</p>

<p>One of the most significant and frequent motifs of the
diabolic in literature is that of the barter of the human
soul for the devil&rsquo;s gift of some earthly boon, long life or
wealth or power, or wisdom, or gratification of the senses.
It is a theme of unusual power,&mdash;what could be greater
than the struggle over one&rsquo;s own immortal soul?&mdash;and well
might the great minds of the world engage themselves
with it. Yet that theme is but little apparent in later
stories. We have no such character in recent literature
that can compare with Marlowe&rsquo;s Dr. Faustus or Goethe&rsquo;s
Mephistopheles or Calderon&rsquo;s wonder-working magician.
Hawthorne&rsquo;s Septimius Felton makes a bargain with
the devil to secure the elixir of life, there is a legend in
Hardy&rsquo;s <cite>Tess of the D&rsquo; Urbervilles</cite> of a man that sold himself
to the minister of evil, and the incident occurs in various
stories of witchcraft, yet with waning power and less
frequence. The most significant recent use of it is in
W.&nbsp;B. Yeats&rsquo;s drama.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> This is a drama of Ireland, where
the peasants have been driven by famine to barter their
souls to the devil to buy their children food, but their
Countess sells her own soul to the demon that they may
save theirs. This vicarious sacrifice adds a new poignancy
to the situation and Yeats has treated it with power.
This is the only recent appearance of the devil on the stage
for he has practically disappeared from English drama,
where he was once so prominent. The demon was a
familiar and leading figure on the miracle and Elizabethan
stage, but, like the ghost, he shows more vitality now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in fiction. The devil is an older figure in English
drama than is the ghost, but he seems to have played
out.</p>

<p>The analysis and representation of the devil as a character
in literature have covered a great range, from the
bestiality of Dante&rsquo;s Demon in the <cite>Inferno</cite> to Milton&rsquo;s
mighty angel in ruins, with all sorts of variations between,
from the sneering cynicism of Goethe&rsquo;s Mephisto to the
pinchbeck diabolism of Marie Corelli&rsquo;s sorrowful Satan,
and the merry humor and blasphemous satire of Mark
Twain&rsquo;s mysterious stranger. We note an especial influence
of Goethe&rsquo;s Mephistopheles in the satiric studies
of the demon, an echo of his diabolic climax when in
answer to Faust&rsquo;s outcry over Margaret&rsquo;s downfall and
death, he says, &ldquo;<em>She is not the first</em>!&rdquo; One hears echoing
through all literature Man Friday&rsquo;s unanswerable question,
&ldquo;Why not God kill debbil?&rdquo; The uses of evil in
God&rsquo;s eternal scheme, the soul&rsquo;s free choice yet pitiful
weakness, are sounded again and again. The great
diabolic figures, in their essential humanity, their intellectual
dignity, their sad introspection, their pitiless testing
of the human soul to its predestined fall, are terrible
allegorical images of the evil in man himself, or concepts
of social sins, as in <cite>Ivan, the Fool</cite>. The devils of the great
writers, reflecting the time, the racial characteristics, the
personal natures of their creators, are deeply symbolic.
Each man creates the devil that he can understand, that
represents him, for, as Amiel says, we can comprehend
nothing of which we have not the beginnings in ourselves.
As each man sees a different Hamlet, so each one has his
own devil, or <em>is</em> his own devil. This is illustrated by the
figure in Julian Hawthorne&rsquo;s <cite>Lovers in Heaven</cite>, where the
dead man&rsquo;s spirit meets the devil in the after life,&mdash;who is
his own image, his dæmonic double. Some have one great
fiend, while others keep packs of little, snarling imps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
darkness. A study of comparative diabolics is illuminating
and might be useful to us all.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">The Wizard and the Witch.</h3> <p class="inline">The demon has his earthly
partners in evil members of the firm of Devil and Company.
Certain persons that have made a pact with him
are given a share in his power, and a portion of his dark
mantle falls upon them. The sorcerer and the witch
are ancient figures in literature, and like others of the
supernatural kingdom, notably the devil, they have their
origin in the East, the cuneiform writings of the Chaldeans
showing belief in witchcraft. And the Witch of Endor,
summoning the spirit of Samuel to confront Saul, is a very
real figure in the Old Testament. The Greeks believed
in witches, as did the Romans. Meroe, a witch, is
described in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> of Lucius Appuleius, from
whom perhaps the witch Meroe in Peele&rsquo;s <cite>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</cite>
gets her name and character. In classical times witches
were thought to have power to turn men into beasts,
tigers, monkeys, or asses&mdash;some persons still believe that
women have that power and might give authenticated
instances.</p>
</div>

<p>The sorcerer, or wizard, or warlock, or magician, as he
is variously called, was a more common figure in early
literature than in later, perhaps because, as in so many
other cases, his profession has suffered a feminine invasion.
The Anglo-Saxon word <em>wicca</em>, meaning &ldquo;witch,&rdquo; is masculine,
which may or may not mean that witchcraft was
a manly art in those days, and the most famous medieval
enchanter, Merlin, was a man, it should be noted. The
sorcerer of primitive times has been gradually reduced in
power, changing through the astrologer and alchemist of
medieval and Gothic romance into the bacteriologist and
biologist of recent fiction, where he works other wonders.
In general, warlocks and wizards, while frequent enough
in early literature and in modern folk-tales, have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
less numerous in later fiction. Scott<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> has a medical
magician with supernatural power of healing by means
of an amulet, which, put to the nostrils of a person practically
dead, revives him at once, but which loses its efficacy
if given in exchange for money. Hawthorne has an old
Indian sachem with wizard power,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> who has concocted
the elixir of life. We see the passing of the ancient sorcerer
into the scientific wonder-worker in such fiction as
Sax Rohmer&rsquo;s Fu-Manchu stories that depict a Chinese
terror, or in H.&nbsp;G. Wells&rsquo;s supernatural investigators in
his various stories of science. The magician is not really
dead in fiction but has passed over into another form, for
the most part.</p>

<p>We still have the hoodoo man of colored persuasion,
and the redskin medicine-man, together with Oriental
sorcerers from Kipling and others. Examples are: <cite>In the
House of Suddoo</cite>, by Kipling, where the wonder-worker
unites a canny knowledge of the telephone and telegraph
along with his unholy art; <cite>Red Debts</cite>, by Lumley
Deakin, where the Indian magician exacts a terrible
penalty for the wrong done him, and where his diabolic
appearance to claim his victim leaves one in doubt
as to whether he has not sent his chief in his place;
<cite>The Monkey&rsquo;s Paw</cite>, by W.&nbsp;W. Jacobs, a curdling story of
a magic curse given by an Oriental sorcerer, by which
the paw of a dead monkey grants three wishes that have
a dreadful boomerang power; <cite>Black Magic</cite>, by Jessie
Adelaide Weston,&mdash;who claims that all her supernatural
stories are strictly true&mdash;the narrative of an old Indian
sorcerer that changes himself into a hair mat and is shot
for his pains. He has obtained power over the house by
being given a hair from the mat by the uninitiated mistress.
Hair, you must know, has great power of evil
in the hands of witches and sorcerers, as in the case of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
evil ones in <cite>The Talisman</cite>, who received their thrall over
the maidens by one hair from each head. F. Marion
Crawford&rsquo;s <cite>Khaled</cite> is a story of magic art. Khaled is
one of the genii converted by reading the Koran, who
wishes to be a mortal man with a soul. He is given
the right to do so if he can win the love of a certain
woman. Hence he is born into the world, like Adam, a
full-grown man, to be magically clothed and equipped,
by the transformation of leaves and twigs into garments
and armor, and the changing of a locust into an Arabian
steed. After many supernatural adventures, he receives
his soul from an angel. The soul, at first a crescent
flame,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">immediately took shape and became the brighter image of
Khaled himself. And when he had looked at it fixedly for a
few minutes&mdash;the vision of himself had disappeared and before
he was aware it had entered his own body and taken up its
life with him.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a parallel to the cases of ghostly doubles discussed
in the previous chapter.</p>

<p>The magician shows a disposition to adapt himself to contemporary
conditions and to change his personality with the
times. Not so the witch. She is a permanent figure. She
has appeared in the various forms of literature, in Elizabethan
drama, in Gothic romance, in modern poetry, the
novel and the short story, and is very much alive to-day.
We have witches young and old. We have the fake witch,
like the hoax ghost; the imputed witch and the genuine
article. We have witch stories melodramatic, romantic,
tragic, comic, and satiric, showing the influence of the
great creations of past literature with modern adaptations
and additions. English poetry is full of witchery, perhaps
largely the result of the Celtic influence on our
literature. The poetic type of witchcraft is brought out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in such poems as Coleridge&rsquo;s <cite>Christabel</cite>, where the beauty
and suggestiveness veil the sense of unearthly evil; or in
Shelley&rsquo;s <cite>Witch of Atlas</cite>, where the woman appears as
a symbol of alluring loveliness possessing none of the
hideous aspects seen in other weird women. The water
enchantress in Shelley&rsquo;s fragment of an unfinished drama
might be mentioned as another example while Keats&rsquo;s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Belle Dame sans Merci</cite> has a magical charm all her own.
Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s <cite>Goblin Market</cite> shows a peculiar aspect
of magic, as also Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s <cite>The Lay of the Brown
Rosary</cite>. On the contrary, Milton&rsquo;s <cite>Comus</cite>, Robert Herrick&rsquo;s
<cite>The Hag</cite>, and James Hogg&rsquo;s <cite>The Witch of Fife</cite> illustrate
the uglier aspects of enchantment.</p>

<p>There are two definite types of witches seen in English
fiction, the first being merely the reputed witch, the woman
who is falsely accused or suspected of black arts, and who
either is persecuted, or else gains what she wishes by hints
of her traffic in evil, like the Old Granny Young in <cite>Mine
Host and the Witch</cite>, by James Blythe, who chants as a
charm-rune,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;A curse shall lay on water and land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the thing denied the witch&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">so that everybody is afraid to refuse her whatever she
demands. This is a highly conventionalized type of the
motif and, though it is found in great numbers in modern
fiction, is not particularly important. The principal complications
of the plot are usually the same, the character
known as the witch being either an appealing figure winning
sympathy because of her beauty and youth, or else
touching to pity because of her age and infirmities. No
person of average age or pulchritude is ever accused of
witchcraft in English fiction. She is always very old and
poor or young and lovely. Item also, she invariably has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
two lovers, in the latter case. She is merely a romantic peg
on which to hang a story, not always real as a human being
and not a real witch. In these stories the only magic used
is love, the fair maid having unintentionally charmed the
heart of a villain, who, failing to win her, accuses her of
witchcraft in order to frighten her into love. In some of
the novels and stories the victim is actually executed,
while in others she is rescued by her noble lover at the
fifty-ninth second. We have the pursuing villain, the
distressed innocence, the chivalric lover disporting themselves
in late Gothic fashion over many romances. Even
Mary Johnston with her knowledge of Colonial times
and her power to give atmosphere to the past does not
succeed in imparting the breath of life to her late novel
of witchcraft, <cite>The Witch</cite>. These pink-and-white beauties
who speak in Euphuistic sentences, who show a lamblike
defiance toward the dark tempters, who breathe prayers
to heaven for protection and forgiveness to their enemies
in one breath, who die or are rescued with equal grace
and propriety,&mdash;one is carried away from the scaffold
by Kidd, the pirate, thus delaying for several chapters
her rescue by her faithful lover&mdash;do not really touch the
heart any more than they interest the intellect. Yet there
are occasional instances of the imputed witch who seems
real despite her handicap of beauty and youth, as Iseult
le Desireuse, in Maurice Hewlett&rsquo;s <cite>Forest Lovers</cite>, whom
Prosper le Gai weds to save from the hangman. The
young woman in F. Marion Crawford&rsquo;s <cite>Witch of Prague</cite>
might be called a problematic witch, for while she does
undoubtedly work magic, it is for the most part attributed
to her powers of hypnotism rather than to the black art
itself. We find an excellent example of the reputed
witch who is a woman of real charm and individuality,
in D&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s <cite>The Daughter of Jorio</cite>, where the young
girl is beset by cruel dangers because of her charm and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
lonely condition, and who rises to tragic heights of sacrifice
to save her lover from death, choosing to be burned
to death as a witch to save him from paying the penalty
of murder. She actually convinces him, as well as the
others, that she has bewitched him by unholy powers,
that she has slain his father and made him believe that he
himself did it to save her honor, and she goes to her death
with a white fervor of courage, with no word of complaint,
save one gentle rebuke to him that <em>he</em> should not revile
her.</p>

<p>The aged pseudo-witch is in the main more appealing
than the young one, because more realistic. Yet there is
no modern instance that is so touching as the poor old
crone in <cite>The Witch of Edmonton</cite>, who is persecuted for
being a witch and who turns upon her tormentors with
a speech that reminds us of Shylock&rsquo;s famous outcry,
showing clearly how their suspicion and accusation have
made her what she is. We see here a witch in the
making, an innocent old woman who is harried by
human beings till she makes a compact with the devil.
Meg Merrilies<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> is a problematic witch, a majestic,
sibylline figure, very individual and human, yet with
more than a suggestion of superhuman wisdom and
power. Scott limned her with a loving hand, and Keats
was so impressed with her personality that he wrote
a poem concerning her. Elizabeth Enderfield, in Hardy&rsquo;s
<cite>Under the Greenwood Tree</cite>, is a reputed witch and witch-pricking
is also tried in his <cite>Return of the Native</cite>. Various
experiments with magic are used in Hardy&rsquo;s work, as
the instance of the woman&rsquo;s touching her withered arm
to the neck of a man that had been hanged, consulting
the conjurer concerning butter that won&rsquo;t come, and so
forth. Old Aunt Keziah in Hawthorne&rsquo;s <cite>Septimius Felton</cite>
might be called a problematic witch, as the woman in <cite>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Witch</cite> by Eden Phillpotts. She has a great number of
cats, and something dreadful happens to anyone who
injures one of them; she calls the three black toads her
servants and goes through incantations over a snake
skeleton, the carcass of a toad, and the mummy of a cat.
Mother Tab may or may not be a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> witch, but
she causes much trouble to those associated with her.</p>

<p>The unquestioned witch, possessing indubitable powers
of enchantment, occurs frequently and conveys a genuine
thrill. Her attributes have been less conventionalized
than those of her youthful companions who are merely
under the imputation of black art, and she possesses a
diabolic individuality. Though she may not remain
long in view, she is an impressive figure not soon forgotten.
The old crone in Scott&rsquo;s <cite>The Two Drovers</cite> gives
warning to Robin Oig, &ldquo;walking the deasil,&rdquo; as it is
called, around him, tracing the propitiation which some
think a reminiscence of Druidical mythology,&mdash;which is
performed by walking three times round the one in
danger, moving according to the course of the sun. In the
midst of her incantation the hag exclaims, &ldquo;Blood on your
hand, and it is English blood!&rdquo; True enough, before his
journey&rsquo;s end young Robin does murder his English companion.
In the same story other evidences of witchcraft
are shown, as the directions for keeping away the evil
influence from cattle by tying <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mungo&rsquo;s knot on their
tails.</p>

<p>The subject of witchcraft greatly interested Hawthorne,
for he introduces it in a number of instances. <cite>Young
Goodman Brown</cite> shows the aspects of the diabolic union
between the devil and his earthly companions, their unholy
congregations in the forest, reports their sardonic conversations
and suggestions of evil in others, and pictures the
witches riding on broomsticks high in the heavens and
working their magic spells. The young husband sees in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that convocation all the persons whom he has most
revered&mdash;his minister, his Sabbath-school teacher, and
even his young wife, so that all his after-life is saddened
by the thought of it. Witchcraft enters into <cite>The Scarlet
Letter</cite>, <cite>Main Street</cite>, and <cite>Feathertop</cite>, and is mentioned
in other stories.</p>

<p>Old Mother Sheehy in Kipling&rsquo;s <cite>The Courting of Dinah
Shadd</cite> pronounces a malediction against Private Mulvany
and the girl he loves, prophesying that he will be reduced
in rank instead of being promoted, will be a slave to
drink so that his young wife will take in washing for
officers&rsquo; wives instead of herself being the wife of an
officer, and that their only child will die,&mdash;every bitter
word of which comes true in after years. The old witch
mother in Howard Pyle&rsquo;s <cite>The Evil Eye</cite> inspires her
daughter to cast a spell over the man she loves but who
does not think of her, causing him to leave his betrothed
and wed the witch daughter. When understanding comes
to him, and with it loathing, the girl seeks to regain his
love by following the counsel of an old magician, who
gives her an image to be burnt. But that burning of the
image kills her and looses the man from her spell. That
incident is similar to that in D&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sogno d&rsquo;un
Tramonto d&rsquo;Autunno</i> where the Dogaressa seeks to slay
her rival, both probably being based on the unforgettable
employment of the theme in Rossetti&rsquo;s <cite>Sister Helen</cite>,
where the young girl causes the death of her betrayer
by melting the image.</p>

<p>In Gordon Bottomley&rsquo;s play, <cite>Riding to Lithend</cite>, three
old women enter, who seem to partake of the nature of
the Parcæ as well as of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Weird Sisters. They
have bat-webbed fingers, the hound bays uncannily at their
approach, they show supernatural knowledge of events,
and they chant a wild prophecy of doom, then mysteriously
disappear. Fate marches swiftly on as they foretell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The young and beautiful witch can work as much evil as
the ancient crone, perhaps more, since her emotions are
wilder and more unrestrained. She can project a curse
that reaches its victim across the ocean, when the one
who sent the curse is rotting in the tomb, as in <cite>The Curse
of the Cashmere Shawl</cite>, where a betrayed and deserted
woman in India sends a rare shawl to her rival, then
drowns herself. Months after, when the husband,
forgetful of the source, lays the shawl around his wife&rsquo;s
shoulders, the dead woman takes her place. After this
gruesome transfer of personality, the wife, impelled by a
terrible urge she cannot understand, drowns herself as
the other has done months before. Oscar Wilde<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> shows
a young and lovely witch with a human longing for the
love of the young man who throws away his soul for love
of a mermaid. Through life&rsquo;s tragic satire, she is compelled,
in spite of her entreaties, to show him how he
may damn himself and win the other&rsquo;s affection. The
jealousy shown here and in other instances is an illustration
of the human nature of the witch, who, like the devil,
makes a strong appeal to our sympathy in spite of the
undoubted iniquity.</p>

<p>The element of symbolism enters largely into the
witch-creations, even from the time of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Three in <cite>Macbeth</cite>, who are terrible symbolic figures of the
evil in man&rsquo;s soul. They appear as the visible embodiment
of Macbeth&rsquo;s thoughts, and by their mysterious
suggestive utterances tempt him to put his unlawful
dreams into action. They seem both cause and effect
here, for though when they first appear to him his hands
are innocent of blood, his heart is tainted with selfish
ambition, and their whispers of promise hurry on the
deed. In <cite>Ancient Sorceries</cite>, by Algernon Blackwood,
the village is full of persons who at night by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
power of an ancestral curse, a heritage of subliminal
memory, become witches, horrible cat-creatures, unhuman,
that dance the blasphemous dance of the Devil&rsquo;s
Sabbath. The story symbolizes the eternal curse that
rests upon evil, the undying quality of thought and action
that cannot cease when the body of the sinner has
become dust, but reaches out into endless generations.</p>

<p>In <cite>Old Fires and Profitable Ghosts</cite> by A.&nbsp;T. Quiller-Couch,
we see a witch, a young woman whose soul is under a spell
from the devil. She gives rich gifts to the church, but her
offerings turn into toads and vipers, defiling the sanctuary,
and as she sings her wild songs the bodies of drowned men
come floating to the surface of the water and join in the
words of her song. Her beauty is supernatural and
accursed, yet her soul is innocent of wish to do evil, though
it leaves her body and goes like a cresseted flame at
night to follow the devil, while the body is powerless in
sleep. Finally the devil comes in the form of a Moor,
possibly a suggestion from <cite>Zofloya</cite>, and summons her,
when she dies, with a crucifix clasped over her heart.</p>

<p>W. B. Yeats has pictured several witches for us, as
the crone of the gray hawk, in <cite>The Wisdom of the King</cite>,
a woman tall with more than mortal height, with
feathers of the gray hawk growing in her hair, who stoops
over the royal cradle and whispers a strange thing to the
child, as a result of which he grows up in a solitude of his
own mystic thoughts with dreams that are like the marching
and counter-marching of armies. When he realizes
that the simple joys of life and love are not for him, he
disappears, some say to make his home with the immortal
demons, some say with the shadowy goddesses that
haunt the midnight pools in the forest. In <cite>The Curse
of the Fires and the Shadows</cite>, Yeats pictures another
witch, tall and in a gray gown, who is standing in the
river and washing, washing the dead body of a man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
As the troopers who have murdered the friars and burned
down the church ride past, each man recognizes in the
dead face his own face,&mdash;just a moment before they
all plunge over the abyss to death.</p>

<p>There are witches in most collections of English folk-tales,
for the simpler people, the more elemental natures,
have a strong feeling for the twilight of nature and of
life. The weird woman has power over the forces of
nature and can evoke the wrath of the elements as
of unholy powers against her enemies. Stories of witches,
as of sorcerers, occur in Indian folk-tales, as well as in those
of the American Indian, differing in details in the tribal
collections yet showing similar essential ideas. The
Scotch show special predilection for the witch, since
with their tense, stern natures, they stand in awe of the
darker powers and of those that call them forth. They
relate curious instances of the relations between the
animal world and witchcraft, as in <cite>The Dark Nameless
One</cite>, by Fiona McLeod, the story of a nun that
falls in love with a seal and is forced to live forever in the
sea, weaving her spells where the white foam froths, and
knowing that her soul is lost. This is akin to the theme
that Matthew Arnold uses,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> though with a different
treatment, showing similarity to Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s
tale of <cite>The Little Mermaid</cite>. The cailleachuisge,
or the water-witch, and the maighdeanmhara, the
mermaid, and the kelpie, the sea-beast, are cursed with
dæmonic spells and live forever in their witchery. When
mortals forsake the earth and follow them their children
are beings that have no souls. The Irish folk-tales,
on the other hand, while having their quota of
witches, do not think so much about them or take them
quite so seriously, inclining more to the faëry forms of
supernaturalism suited to their poetic natures. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
sense of beauty of the Irish is so vivid and their innate
poetry so intense that they glimpse the loveliness of
magic, and their enchanted beings are of beauty rather
than of horror.</p>

<p>We even have the humorous and satiric witch, to
correspond to similar representations of the ghost and the
devil in modern fiction. The instance in Burns&rsquo;s <cite>Tam
O&rsquo;Shanter</cite> needs only to be recalled, with the ludicrous
description of the wild race at night to escape the dread
powers. <cite>Bones, Sanders, and Another</cite>, by Edgar Wallace,
introduces a witch with comic qualities, a woman whose
husband has been a magician, and the reputed familiar
of a devil. She cures people by laying her hands on
them, once causing a bone that was choking a child to
fly out with &ldquo;a cry terrible to hear, such a cry as a leopard
makes when pursued by ghosts.&rdquo; When this witch with
a sense of humor is arrested as a trouble-maker by an
army officer, she &ldquo;eradicates&rdquo; her clothes, causing very
comic complications. The best example of the satiric
witch is Hawthorne&rsquo;s Mother Rigby, in <cite>Feathertop</cite>, who
constructs a man from a broomstick and other materials
for a scarecrow. In this satiric sermon upon the shams and
hypocrisies of life, Mother Rigby, with her sardonic humor,
her cynical comments, parodies society, holds the mirror
up to human life and shows more than one poor painted
scarecrow, simulacrum of humanity, masquerading as a
man. The figure that she creates, with his yearnings and
his pride, his horror when he realizes his own falsity and
emptiness, is more human, more a man, than many a
being we meet in literature or in life.</p>

<p>Barry Pain has several witch stories that do not fall
readily into any category, curious stories of scientific
dream-supernaturalism, in the realm of the unreal.
<cite>Exchange</cite> is the account of a supernatural woman, whether
a witch or one of the Fates, one does not know, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
comes, clad in scarlet rags, to show human souls their destinies.
She permits an exchange of fate, if one is willing
to pay her price, which is in each case terrible enough.
One young girl gives up her pictured future of life and
love, and surrenders her mind for the purpose of saving
her baby brother from his destined fate of suicide in
manhood. The crone appears to an old man that loves the
child, who takes upon himself her fate of being turned
into a bird to be tortured after human death, so that the
young girl may have his future, to be turned into a white
lamb that dies after an hour, then be a soul set free.
<cite>The Glass of Supreme Moments</cite> is another story of prophetic
witchery, of revealed fate seen in supernatural
dreams. A young man in his college study sees the
fireplace turn into a silver stairway down which a lovely
gray-robed woman comes to him. She shows him a
mirror, the glass of supreme moments, in which the
highest instants of each man&rsquo;s life are shown. She says
of it, &ldquo;All the ecstasy of the world lies there. The
supreme moments of each man&rsquo;s life, the scene, the spoken
words&mdash;all lie there. Past and present and future&mdash;all
are there.&rdquo; She shows an emotion meter that measures
the thrill of joy. After he has seen the climactic instants
of his friends&rsquo; lives he asks to see his own, when she tells
him his are here and now. She tells him that her name is
Death and that he will die if he kisses her, but he cries
out, &ldquo;I will die kissing you!&rdquo; And presently his mates
return to find his body fallen dead across his table.</p>

<p>There is something infinitely appealing about the character
of the witch. She seems a creature of tragic loneliness,
conscious of her own dark powers, yet conscious
also of her exile from the good, and knowing that all
the evil she evokes will somehow come back to her, that
her curses will come home, as in the case of <cite>Witch Hazel</cite>,
where the witch, by making a cake of hair to overcome her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
rival in love, brings on a tempest that kills her lover and
drives her mad. Each evil act, each dark imagining
seems to create a demon and turn him loose to harry
humanity with unceasing force, as Matthew Maule&rsquo;s
curse in <cite>The House of Seven Gables</cite> casts a spiritual shadow
on the home. Yet the witch is sometimes a minister of
good, as Mephistopheles says of himself, achieving the good
where he meant evil; sometimes typifying the mysterious
mother nature, as the old Wittikin in Hauptmann&rsquo;s <cite>Sunken
Bell</cite>, neither good nor evil, neither altogether human nor
supernatural. Her strange symbolism is always impressive.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">Dæmonic Spirits&mdash;Vampires.</h3> <p class="inline">Closely related to the
devil are certain diabolic spirits that are given supernatural
power by him and acknowledge his suzerainty.
These include ghouls, vampires, werewolves, and other
demoniac animals, as well as the human beings that
through a compact with the fiend share in his dark force.
Since such creatures possess dramatic possibilities, they
have given interest to fiction and other literature from
early times. This idea of an unholy alliance between
earth and hell, has fascinated the human mind and been
reflected astonishingly in literature. In studying the
appearance of these beings in English fiction, we note, as
in the case of the ghost, the witch, and the devil, a certain
leveling influence, a tendency to humanize them and
give them characteristics that appeal to our sympathy.</p>
</div>

<p>The vampire and the ghoul are closely related and by
some authorities are considered the same, yet there is a
distinction. The ghoul is a being, to quote Poe, &ldquo;neither
man nor woman, neither brute nor human&rdquo; that feeds
upon corpses, stealing out at midnight for loathsome
banquets in graveyards. He devours the flesh of the
dead, while the vampire drains the blood of the living.
The ghoul is an Asiatic creature and has left but slight
impress upon English literature, while the vampire has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
been a definite motif. The vampire superstition goes
back to ancient times, being referred to on Chaldean and
Assyrian tablets. William of Newbury, of the twelfth
century in England, relates several stories of them; one
vampire was burned in Melrose Abbey, and tourists in
Ireland are still shown the grave of a vampire. Perhaps
the vampire superstition goes back to the savagery of
remote times, and is an animistic survival of human
sacrifices, of cannibalism and the like. The vampire
is thought of as an evil spirit issuing forth at night to
attack the living in their sleep and drain the blood which
is necessary to prolong its own revolting existence. Certain
persons were thought to be especially liable to become
vampires at death, such as suicides, witches, wizards,
persons who in life had been attacked by vampires, outcasts
of various kinds, as well as certain animals, werewolves,
dead lizards, and others.</p>

<p>The vampire superstition was general in the East and
extended to Europe, it is thought, by way of Greece.
The Greeks thought of the vampire as a beautiful young
woman, a lamia, who lured young men to their death.
The belief was particularly strong in central Europe,
but never seemed to gain the same foothold in England
that it did on the continent, though it is evident here
and has influenced literature. The vampire has been the
inspiration for several operas, and has figured in the
drama, in poetry, in the novel and short story, as well as
in folk-tales and medieval legends. The stories show
the various aspects of the belief and its ancient hold on the
popular mind. The vampire, as well as the ghost, the
devil, and the witch, has appeared on the English stage.
<cite>The Vampire</cite>, an anonymous melodrama in two acts,
<cite>The Vampire</cite>, a tragedy by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John Dorset (1821), <cite>The
Vampire Bride</cite>, a play, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Vampire</cite>, by Alexander Dumas
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">père</cite>, and <cite>The Vampire, or the Bride of the Isles</cite>, by J.&nbsp;R.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Planche, were presented in the London theater. The
latter which was published in 1820 is remarkably similar
to <cite>The Vampyre</cite>, a novelette by Polidori, published in
1819,&mdash;the story written after the famous ghost session
where Byron, the Shelleys, and Polidori agreed each to
write a ghostly story, Mary Shelley writing <cite>Frankenstein</cite>.</p>

<p>Polidori&rsquo;s story, like the play referred to, has for its
principal character an Englishman, Lord Ruthven, the
Earl of Marsden, who is the vampire. In each case
there is a supposed death, where the dying man asks
that his body be placed where the last rays of the moon
can fall upon it. The corpse then mysteriously vanishes.
In each story there is a complication of a rash pledge of
silence made by a man that discovers the diabolical nature
of the earl, who, having risen from the dead, is ravaging
society as a vampire. In each case a peculiar turn of
the story is that the masculine vampire requires for his
subsistence the blood of young women, to whom he
must be married. He demands a new victim, hence a
hurried wedding is planned. In the play the ceremony
is interrupted by the bride&rsquo;s father, but in the novelette
the plot is finished and the girl becomes the victim of the
destroyer. It is a question which of these productions
was written first, and which imitated the other, or if
they had a common source. The author of the drama
admits getting his material from a French play, but
where did Polidori get his?</p>

<p>Byron seems to have been fascinated with the vampire
theme, for in addition to his unsuccessful short story,
he has used the theme in his poem, <cite>The Giaour</cite>. Here
he brings in the idea that the vampire curse is a judgment
from God for sin, and that the most terrible part
of the punishment is the being forced to prey upon those
who in life were dearest to him, which idea occurs in
various stories.</p>

<p>Keats uses the Greek idea of the vampire as a lamia or
beautiful young woman luring young men to death,&mdash;the
same theme employed by Goethe in his <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Braut
von Corinth</cite>. In <cite>Lamia</cite>, when the evil spirit in the form
of a lovely, alluring woman, is accused by the old philosopher,
she gives a terrible scream and vanishes. This
vanishing business is a favorite trick with vampires&mdash;they
leave suddenly when circumstances crowd them.</p>

<p>F. Marion Crawford, in <cite>For the Blood Is the Life</cite>, has
given us a terrible vampire story, in which the dream
element is present to a marked degree. The young man,
who has been vainly loved by a young girl, is after her
death vampirized by her, something after the fashion
of Turgeniev&rsquo;s Clara Militch, and when his friends get
an inkling of the truth, and go to rescue him, they find
him on her grave, a thin red line of blood trickling from
his throat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>And the flickering light of the lantern played upon another

drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The hawthorne stake is driven through her heart and
the vampire expires after a terrific struggle, uttering diabolic,
human shrieks. There is a certain similarity
between this and Gautier&rsquo;s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Morte Amoreuse</cite>, where the
truth is concealed till the last of the story and only the
initiated would perhaps know that the reincarnated woman
was a vampire. It is also a bit like Turgeniev&rsquo;s <cite>Phantoms</cite>,
where a subtle suggestion at the last gives the reader
the clue to vampirism, though the author really asks
the question at the close, Was she a vampire? The character
of the woman is problematic here, as in Gautier&rsquo;s
story, less pronounced than in Crawford&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The idea of occult vampirism used by Turgeniev is
also employed by Reginald Hodder in his work, <cite>The
Vampire</cite>. Here peculiar power is possessed by a woman
leader of an occult band, who vampirizes by means of a
talisman. Her ravages are psychic rather than physical.
Theosophists, according to the <cite>Occult Magazine</cite>, believe
in vampires even in the present. According to their
theory, one who has been very wicked in life is in death
so inextricably entangled with his evil motives and acts
that he is hopelessly lost and knows it, yet seeks to delay
for a time his final damnation. He can ward off spiritual
death so long as he can keep alive by means of blood
his physical corpse. The <cite>Occult Review</cite> believes that
probably only those acquainted with black magic in their
lifetime can become vampires,&mdash;a thought comforting
to some of us.</p>

<p>It is in Bram Stoker&rsquo;s <cite>Dracula</cite> that one finds the tensest,
most dreadful modern story of vampirism. This novel
seems to omit no detail of terror, for every aspect of vampire
horror is touched upon with brutal and ghastly
effect. The combination of ghouls, vampires, ghosts, werewolves,
and other awful elements is almost unendurable,
yet the book loses in effect toward the last, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
mind cannot endure four hundred pages of vampiric
outrage and respond to fresh impressions of horror. The
initial vampire here is a Hungarian count, who, after
terrorizing his own country for years, transports himself
to England to start his ravages there. Each victim in
turn becomes a vampire. The combination of modern
science with medieval superstition to fight the scourge,
using garlic and sprigs of the wild rose together with
blood transfusion, is interesting. All the resources of
modern science are pitted against the infection and the
complications are dramatically thrilling. The book is
not advised as suitable reading for one sitting alone at
night.</p>

<p>There are other types of vampirism in addition to the
conventional theme and the occult vampirism. H.&nbsp;G.
Wells gives his customary twist of novelty to supernaturalism
by the introduction of a botanical vampire
in his <cite>The Flowering of the Strange Orchid</cite>. An orchid
collector is found unaccountably dead in a jungle in the
Andaman Islands, with a strange bulb lying under him,
which bulb is brought to England and watched carefully
by a botanist there till it comes to flower. When at
last its blossoms burst open, great tentacles reach out to
grasp the man, sucking his blood and strangling him. The
tentacles dripping blood have to be torn away and the
man snatched violently from the plant just in time to
save his life.</p>

<p>Algernon Blackwood, who has touched upon every
terrible aspect of supernaturalism, gives us two types of
vampires in his story, <cite>The Transfer</cite>. The one is a psychic
vampire, stealing the vital power from others, a human
sponge, absorbing the strength, the ideas, the soul, of
others. The governess describes him: &ldquo;I watched his
hard, bleak face; I noticed how thin he was, and the
curious, oily brightness of his steady eyes. And everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
he said or did announced what I may dare to call
the <em>suction</em> of his presence.&rdquo; This human vampire comes
in contact with one of another sort, a soil vampire, the
Forbidden Corner, a bald, sore place in the rose garden,
like a dangerous bog. The woman and a little child
know the truth of this spot so barren in the midst of
luxurious growth, so sinister in its look and implication.
The child says of it, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad. It&rsquo;s hungry. It&rsquo;s dying
because it can&rsquo;t get the food it wants. But I know what
would make it feel right.&rdquo; The earth vampire stretches
out silent feelers from its secret strength when the man
comes near the evil spot; the empty, yawning spot gives
out audible cries, then laughs hideously as the man falls
forward into the middle of the patch. &ldquo;His eyes, as he
dropped, faded shockingly, and across the countenance
was written plainly what I can only call an expression of
destruction.&rdquo; The man lives on physically, yet without
vitality, without real life. But it was otherwise with the
Forbidden Corner, for soon &ldquo;it lay untouched, full of
great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong,
full-fed and bursting thick with life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the vampire stories vary in theme and in treatment.
Indian folk-tales appearing in English show that
the Jigar-Khor, or Liver-eater of India is a cousin to the
vampire, for he can steal your liver by just looking at
you. (It has long been known that hearts can be filched
in this way, but the liver wrinkle is a new one.) There
are several points to be noted in connection with these
stories of the Un-dead, the incorruptible corpses, the
loathsome spirits that haunt the living. Many of the
stories have a setting in the countries where the vampire
superstition has been most common, though there are
English settings as well. Continental countries are richer
in vampire lore than England, which explains the location
of the incidents even in many English stories and poems.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Another point to be noted is the agreement of the stories
in the essential features. While there are numerous
variants, of course, there is less divergence than in the
case of ghosts, for instance. The description of the
dæmonic spirit tenanting the body of a dead person,
driving him by a dreadful urge to attack the living,
especially those dear to him in life, is much the same.
The personality of the vampire may vary, in one line
of stories being a young woman who lures men to
death, in the other a man who must quench his thirst
with the blood of brides. These are the usual types,
though there are other variants.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">The Werewolf and Others.</h3> <p class="inline">Another dæmonic figure
popular in fiction is the werewolf. The idea is a very old
one, having been mentioned by various classical writers, it
is said, including Pomponius Mela, Herodotus, and Ovid.
The legend of the werewolf is found in practically all
European countries, especially those where the wolf is
common. In France many stories of the loup-garou are
current. The werewolf is a human being cursed with the
power or the obligation to be transformed into an animal
who goes forth to slay and devour. Like a vampire, he
might become such as a curse from God, or he might
be an innocent victim, or might suffer from an atavistic
tendency, a cannibalistic craving for blood. Distinction
is to be made between the real werewolf and the lycanthrope,&mdash;the
latter a human being who, on account of some
peculiar twist of insanity, fancies himself a wolf and acts
accordingly. There is such a character in <cite>The Duchess
of Malfi</cite>, a maniac who thinks himself a mad wolf, and
another in <cite>The Albigenses</cite>, a creature that crouches in a
corner of its lair, gnawing at a skull snatched from the
graveyard, uttering bestial growls. Algernon Blackwood
has a curdling story of lycanthropy, where the insane
man will eat nothing but raw meat and devours everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
living that he can get hold of. He confesses to a
visitor that he used to bite his old servant, but that he
gave it up, since the old Jew tasted bitter. The servant
also is mad, and &ldquo;hides in a vacuum&rdquo; when his master
goes on a rampage. Stories of lycanthropy illustrate an
interesting aspect of the association between insanity
and the supernatural in fiction.</p>
</div>

<p>The most revolting story of lycanthropy is in Frank
Norris&rsquo;s posthumous novel, <cite>Vandover and the Brute</cite>. This
is a study in soul degeneration, akin to the moral decay
that George Eliot has shown in the character of Tito
Melema, but grosser and utterly lacking in artistic restraint.
We see a young man, at first sensitive, delicate,
and with high ideals, gradually through love of ease and
self-indulgence, through taking always the line of least
resistance, becoming a moral outcast. The brute that
ever strains at the leash in man gains the mastery and the
artist soul ends in a bestial creature. Dissipation brings
on madness, called by the doctors &ldquo;lycanthropy-mathesis.&rdquo;
In his paroxysms of insanity the wretch thinks
that his body is turned into the beast that his soul symbolizes,
and runs about his room, naked, four-footed,
growling like a jungle animal and uttering harsh, raucous
cries of <em>Wolf-wolf!</em></p>

<p>Kipling&rsquo;s <cite>The Mark of the Beast</cite> is midway between a
lycanthrope and a werewolf story, for while the soul of the
beast&mdash;or whatever passes for the brutish soul&mdash;enters
into the man and drives out his spirit, and while
many bestial characteristics result, including the revolting
odor, the man does not change his human
form.</p>

<p>While lycanthropy has never been a frequent theme in
fiction, the werewolf is a common figure, appearing in
various forms of literature, from medieval ballads and
legends to modern short stories. Marie de France, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Anglo-Norman writer,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> tells of a werewolf that is by day
a gallant knight and kindly gentleman, yet goes on
nocturnal marauding expeditions. When his wife shows
curiosity concerning his absences and presses him for an
explanation, he reluctantly tells her that he is a werewolf,
hiding his clothes in a hollow tree, and that if they were
removed he would have to remain a wolf. She has her
lover steal his clothes, then marries the lover. One day
long afterward the king&rsquo;s attention is called to a wolf that
runs up to him and acts strangely. It is a tame and well-mannered
beast till the false knight and his wife appear,
when he tries to tear their throats. Investigation reveals
the truth, the clothes are fetched, and the curse removed.
Arthur O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s modern version of this, as of
others of Marie&rsquo;s <i lang="br" xml:lang="br">lais</i>, is charming.</p>

<p>Like the vampire, the werewolf is under a curse that
impels him to prey upon those dearest to him. Controlled
by a dæmonic spirit, the human being, that in his normal
personality is kindly and gentle, becomes a jungle beast
with ravening instincts. The motif is obviously tangled
up with the vampire superstition here, and it would be
interesting, if possible, to trace out the two to a point of
combination. This irresistible impulse to slay his dear
ones introduces a dramatic element into the plot, here as
in the vampire stories. The wolf is not the only animal
around whom such plots center, but being most common
he has given his name to the type. <cite>The Albigenses</cite>
tell of a young husband who, as a werewolf, slays his
bride, then vanishes to be seen no more.</p>

<p>There are interesting variants of the werewolf story,
introducing other elements of supernaturalism. In <cite>A
Vendetta of the Jungle</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> we have the idea of successive
infection of the moral curse, similar to the continuation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
vampirism. Mrs. Crump, a lady in India, is eaten by a
tiger, who has a good digestion for he assimilates not
only her body but her soul. So that now it is Mrs.
Crump-Tiger, we might say, that goes about the jungle
eating persons. In time she devours her successor in
her husband&rsquo;s affection. The man is aware that it is
his first wife who has eaten his second, so he starts out to
kill the animal to clear off the score. But by the time he
reaches the jungle the beast has had time to digest his
meal and when the husband levels his gun to fire, the
eyes that look out at him from the brutish face are his
beloved&rsquo;s eyes. What could he do?</p>

<p>Eugene Field gives a new turn to the idea by representing
the werewolf curse as a definite atavistic throw-back.
His wolf-man is an innocent marauder, the reincarnation
of a wicked grandfather, yet a gentle, chivalrous soul very
different from his grandparent. The old gentleman has
left him heir to nothing but the curse and a magic spear
given him by the witch Brunhilde. The werewolf bears
a charmed life against which no weapon of man can
avail, and the country is panic-stricken over his ravages.
The legend is that the beast&rsquo;s fury cannot be stopped till
some man offers himself as a voluntary sacrifice to the
wolf. The youth does not know that he is the guilty
one until his reprehensible grandfather appears to him in
a vision, demanding his soul. He hears that there is to be
a meeting in the sacred grove on a certain day and begs
his beloved to remain away, lest the werewolf come.
But when she insists that she will go, he gives her his
magic spear, telling her to strike the wolf through the
heart if he approaches her. True to his accursed destiny
the wolf does come to the grove and lunges at the girl. All
the men flee but one, and his weapons fail,&mdash;then the terrified
girl hurls the spear, striking the beast to the heart. But
when he falls, it is young Harold who is dying, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
given himself a voluntary sacrifice to save others. The
curse is lifted but he is dead.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Camp of the Dog</cite>, by Algernon Blackwood, we
have another unconscious werewolf, a gentle, modest,
manly young fellow madly in love with a girl who doesn&rsquo;t
care for him. In his sleep he goes questing for her.
While his body lies shrunken on a cot in his tent, his soul
takes the form of a wolf and goes to the hilltop, uttering
unearthly howls. By an equally strong psychic disturbance
the girl is impelled to go in a somnambulistic state
to the hilltop. Each is in waking hours utterly unaware
of their strange jaunts, till the father shoots the wolf.
The young man in this case suffers only curious psychic
wounds, from which he recovers when the girl promises
to marry him, and the wolf is seen no more.</p>

<p>The panther plays his part in this were-menagerie.
Ambrose Bierce, in <cite>The Eyes of the Panther</cite>, tells of a
young girl who, because of a prenatal curse similar to
that affecting Elsie Venner, is not wholly human. She is
conscious of her dual nature and tells the man she loves
that she cannot marry him since she is a panther by night.
He thinks her mildly insane till one night a settler sees a
beast&rsquo;s eyes glaring into his window and fires. When they
follow the blood-tracks, they find the girl dying. This
is one of the conventions of the werewolf story, the
wounding of an animal that escapes and the blood-trail
that leads to a human being wounded just as the beast
was.</p>

<p>Elliott O&rsquo;Donnell, in a volume called <cite>Werewolves</cite> published
in London in 1912, gives serious credence to the
existence of werewolves not only in the past but also
in the present. He tells a number of stories of what he
claims are authenticated instances of such beings in actual
life. He relates the experience of a man who told him
that he had himself seen a youth turn himself into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
tiger after preparatory passes of enchantment. The
watcher made haste to climb a sacred Vishnu tree when the
transformation was complete. O&rsquo;Donnell tells a tale of a
widow with three children that married a Russian nobleman.
She saw him and his servant change into werewolves,
at least partially, remaining in a half state,
devouring her children whom she left behind in her escape.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Donnell relates several stories of authentic (according
to him) werewolf stories of England in recent times,
giving the dates and places and names of the persons
who saw the beasts. The incidents may be similar to
those spoken of in Dickens&rsquo;s <cite>Haunted House</cite>, where the
famous &ldquo;&rsquo;ooded woman with the howl&rdquo; was seen,&mdash;or at
least, many persons saw the owl and knew that the woman
must be near by. These witnesses of werewolves may
have seen animals, all right enough. Modernity is combined
with medieval superstition here, and it seems
uncanny, for instance, to identify a werewolf by means
of an electric pocket flashlight.</p>

<p>In collections of folk-tales, the tribal legends of the
American redmen as well as of Kipling&rsquo;s India and of
England, there are various stories of werewolves. Among
primitive peoples there is a close relation between the
brute and the human and the attributing of human characteristics
and powers to the beast and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i> is common,
so that this supernatural transfer of personality is
natural enough. A madwolf might suggest the idea for
a werewolf.</p>

<p>Algernon Blackwood advances the theory that the werewolf
is a true psychical fact of profound importance,
however it may have been garbled by superstition. He
thinks that the werewolf is the projection of the untamed
slumbering sanguinary instincts of man, &ldquo;scouring the
world in his fluidic body, the body of desire.&rdquo; As the
mind wanders free from the conscious control of the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in sleep, so the body may free itself from the fetters of
mind or of custom and go forth in elemental form to satisfy
its craving to slay, to slake its wild thirst for blood.
O&rsquo;Donnell says that werewolves may be phantasms of
the dead that cannot be at peace, or a certain kind of
Elementals. He also thinks that they may be the projection
of one phase of man&rsquo;s nature, of the cruelty latent in
mankind that seeks expression in this way. According
to that theory, a chap might have a whole menagerie
inside him, to turn loose at intervals, which would be
exciting but rather risky for society. It was doubtless
a nature such as this that Maupassant attempts to
describe in his story <cite>The Wolf</cite>, where the man has all the
instincts of the wolf yet never changes his human form.</p>

<p>The werewolf in fiction has suffered the same leveling
influence that we have observed in the case of the ghost,
the devil, the witch, and the vampire. He is becoming a
more psychical creature, a romantic figure to be sympathized
with, rather than a beast to be utterly condemned.
In recent fiction the werewolf is represented
as an involuntary and even unconscious departure from
the human, who is shocked when he learns the truth
about himself. Whether he be the victim of a divine
curse, an agent of atavistic tendencies, or a being who thus
gives vent to his real and brutish instincts, we feel a sympathy
with him. We analyze his motives&mdash;at a safe
distance&mdash;seek to understand his vagaries and to estimate
his kinship with us. We think of him now as a noble
figure in fiction, a lupine Galahad like Blackwood&rsquo;s, a
renunciatory hero like Eugene Field&rsquo;s or what not. Or
we reflect that he may be a case of metempsychosis and
treat him courteously, for who knows what we may be
ourselves some day? The werewolf has not figured in
poetry or in the drama as have other supernatural beings,
as the ghost, the devil, the witch, the vampire,&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
wonders why. He is a dramatic figure and his character-analysis
might well furnish themes for poetry though stage
presentation would have its difficulties.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps the revival of interest in Elizabethan literature
has had a good deal to do with the use of supernatural
beings in literature of recent times. The devil and the
dæmonic spirits he controls, the witches and wizards, the
vampires, the enchanted animals, to whom he delegates
a part of his infernal power, appear as impressive moral
allegories, mystical stories of life, symbols of truths. As
literature is a reflection of life, the evil as well as the good
enters in. But since the things of the spirit are intangible
they must be represented in concrete form, as definite
beings whom our minds can apprehend. Thus the poets
and dramatists and story-makers must show us images
to shadow forth spiritual things. As with a shudder
we close the books that tell us horrifying tales of satanic
spirits, of accursed beings that are neither wholly animal
nor human, of mortals with diabolic powers, we shrink
from the evils of the soul that they represent, and recognize
their essential truth in the guise of fiction.</p>

<span class="stl">Supernatural Life</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> fiction dealing with immortal life shows, more
than any other aspect of the subject, humanity&rsquo;s
deep hunger for the supernatural. Whether it be
stories of continuance of earthly existence without death
as in the legends of the undying persons like the Wandering
Jew; or of supernaturally renewed or preserved youth as
described in the tales of the elixir of life; or of the transference
of the soul after death into another body; or of life
continued in the spirit in other worlds than this after the
body&rsquo;s death,&mdash;all show our craving for something above
and beyond what we know here and now. Conscious
of our own helplessness we long to feel ourselves leagued
with immortal powers; shrinking affrighted from the
grave&rsquo;s near brink we yearn for that which would spare
us death&rsquo;s sting and victory. Sadly knowing with what
swift, relentless pace old age is overtaking us we would
fain find something to give us eternal youth. But since
we cannot have these gifts in our own persons we seek
them vicariously in fiction, and for a few hours&rsquo; leisured
forgetfulness we are endowed with immortal youth and
joy. Or, looking past death, we can feel ourselves more
than conquerors in a life beyond.</p>

<p>We somehow snatch a strange comfort from these
stories of a life beyond our own. We are comforted for
our mortality when we see the tragedy that dogs the steps
of those who may not die, whether Swift&rsquo;s loathsome
Struldbrugs or the Wandering Jew. Our own ignorance
of the future makes us credulous of any man&rsquo;s dream of
heaven and at the same time sceptical of anybody else&rsquo;s
hell. We are such indestructible optimists that we
can take any sort of raw material of fiction and transmute
it into stuff that hope is made of.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">The Wandering Jew.</h3> <p class="inline">There is no legend more impressive
than that of the Wandering Jew, and none save the
Faust theme that has so influenced literature. The story
is as deathless as the person it portrays and has wandered
into as many lands, though it is impossible to trace with
certainty its origin or first migrations. There is an Arabian
legend of one Samiri who forever wanders, crying, &ldquo;Touch
me not!&rdquo; as there is a Buddhist account of a man cursed
for working miracles for show, to whom Buddha said,
&ldquo;Thou shalt not attain Nirvana while my religion lasts.&rdquo;
There are similar Chinese and Indian versions and the
idea occurs in English folk-tales, where the plovers are
thought to be the souls of those that crucified Christ,
condemned to fly forever over the world, uttering their
plaintive cry.</p>
</div>

<p>The first appearance of the Wandering Jew in English
literature is in the Chronicles of Roger of Wendover, who
reports the legend as being told at the monastery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Albans by an Armenian bishop, in 1228, but to hearers
already familiar with it. There are two distinct versions
of the story appearing in English literature. One relates
that the wanderer is a certain Cartapholus, a servant in
Pilate&rsquo;s palace, who struck Jesus a brutal blow as He was
led forth to death, and to whom He said, &ldquo;Thou shalt
wander till I come!&rdquo; The other is of German origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
giving the personality of Ahasuerus, a shoemaker of
Jerusalem, who mocked the Savior as He passed to Golgotha.
Bowed under the weight of the cross, Christ leaned
for a moment&rsquo;s rest against the door of the little shop, but
Ahasuerus said scornfully, &ldquo;Go faster, Jew!&rdquo; With
one look of deep reproach, Christ answered, &ldquo;I go, but
tarry thou till I come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wandering Jew story is cosmopolitan, used in the
literature of many lands. In Germany it has engaged
the attention of Berthold Auerbach, Kingemann, Schlegel,
Julius Mosen, and Chamisso, in France that of Edgar
Quinet and Eugene Sue. Hans Christian Andersen has
used it while Heijermans has written a Dutch play on it
and Carmen Sylva, late Queen of Roumania, made it the
basis for a long dramatic poem.</p>

<p>The theme has appeared in various forms in English
literature, besides in fiction where it has been most prominent.
A comedy<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> was published in 1797, by Andrew
Franklin, though the wanderer is here used only as a hoax.
Wordsworth has a poem entitled The <cite>Song of the Wandering
Jew</cite>, and Shelley was fascinated by the legend, as
we see from the fact that he used it three times. One of
his first poems, a long dramatic attempt, written at eighteen,
is <cite>The Wandering Jew</cite>, a fevered poem showing the
same weaknesses that his Gothic romances reveal, yet
with a hint of his later power. The Wandering Jew
appears as a definite character in both <cite>Queen Mab</cite> and
<cite>Hellas</cite>, in the first Ahasuerus being summoned to testify
concerning God, while he appears in the latter to give
supernatural vision of events. In both poems he is very
old, for in the first it is said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;His port and mien bore marks of many years....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet his cheek bore the mark of youth,&rdquo; while in the
latter he is described as being &ldquo;so old he seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
outlived a world&rsquo;s decay.&rdquo; Shelley follows the German
version, as used in a fragment he picked up torn and
soiled in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, whose author he did not
know.</p>

<p>Mr. Eubule-Evans, in a long dramatic poem of considerable
power,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> tells the story of Theudas, who could be
released from his doom of immortality if only he would
repent, but he will not. He renews his youth every
forty years, growing suddenly from a decrepit man to a
handsome, gifted youth, which naturally suggests complications
of human love-affairs. Other elements of
supernaturalism are used, as angels, demons, and so forth
while the Æons and the Intermedii (whoever they are!)
appear as chorus.</p>

<p><cite>The Wandering Jew, a Christmas Carol</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> retells the
story with variations and with some power. The Jew
here is shown to be very old and feeble, clad in antique
raiment, with stigmata of the wounds on hands and feet.
He is symbolic of the Christ, of His failure to win men.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;For lo, at last I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lineaments of that diviner Jew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That like a Phantom passeth everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world&rsquo;s last hope and bitterest despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deathless, yet dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! while all men come and pass away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That phantom of the Christ, forlorn and gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunteth the earth, with desolate footfall.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Wandering Jew is seen definitely once in Gothic
fiction, in Lewis&rsquo;s <cite>The Monk</cite>, where a mysterious stranger,
bearing on his forehead a burning cross imprinted, appears
and is spoken of as the Wandering Jew. He is unable to
stay more than fourteen days in any one place but must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
forever hurry on. Rev. T. Clark<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> gives a bird&rsquo;s-eye
view of history such as a person of the long life and extensive
migrations of the wanderer would see it.</p>

<p>The idea of a deathless man appealed strongly to Hawthorne,
who plays with the theme in various passages
in his works and notebooks. In <cite>A Virtuoso&rsquo;s Collection</cite>,
where Peter Rugg, the Missing Man, is door-keeper and
where the collection includes a letter from the Flying
Dutchman to his wife, together with a flask of the elixir
of life, the virtuoso himself is none other than the Wandering
Jew. He speaks of his destiny and says that human
prayers will not avail to aid him. The touch of his hand
is like ice, conveying a sense of spiritual as well as physical
chill. The character appears also as one of the guests
in <cite>A Select Party</cite>, of whom the author remarks: &ldquo;This
personage, however, had latterly grown so common by
mingling in all sorts of society and appearing at the beck
of every entertainer that he could hardly be deemed a
proper guest in an exclusive circle.&rdquo; This bit of satire
illustrates how common the theme had become at that
time in fiction.</p>

<p>There are various threads of narration tangled up with
the Wandering Jew motif. He is said by some writers
to have supernatural power to heal disease, while by others
he is thought to be the helpless bearer of evil and death.
Eugène Sue in his novel represents him as carrying the
plague, knowing his awful destiny, yet, while wildly
regretting it, powerless in the clutch of fate. Here he
appears as a voluntary agent of good toward the Rennepont
family and an involuntary minister of evil in other
ways. An anonymous story<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> uses the same idea of the
plague association but carries it further, for here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
wanderer is not a personality but the plague itself, passing
like a doom over the world, which shows how far
that phase of the legend has gone.</p>

<p>The legend has been utilized variously to impress
religious truths. Charles Granville<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> writes a symbolic
story with a definite religious message. The idea of the
immortal wanderer is represented as the concept of a part
of humanity urged by an earnest longing which dominates
their whole life and thought, the desire that a new kingdom
of God might come. The book is a social satire, an appeal
for the coming of a real democracy, real justice and genuine
spirituality. George Croly<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> has for his purpose the proving
that Christ&rsquo;s second coming is near at hand. Lew Wallace,
who himself uses the theme of the Wanderer, thought
this book one of the half dozen volumes which taken alone
would constitute a British literature. We are likely
to find ourselves questioning Wallace&rsquo;s judgment in the
matter, for while the novel is interesting and has a sermon
impressed with some interest, it is by no means a great
piece of literature. Salathiel is pictured as a young,
enthusiastic, passionate Jew striving to defend his country
against the woes that threaten her. His life is given in
detail immediately following his unpardonable sin, and
his definite career ends with the destruction of Jerusalem,
though his immortality is suggested at the close. The
book describes many supernatural happenings, the miraculous
phenomena accompanying the death of Christ and
manifestations following the fate of the city.</p>

<p>In Lew Wallace&rsquo;s <cite>The Prince of India</cite> the deathless
man appears again. In the beginning of the story he
enters a vault from which he removes the treasure from
mummy cases, remarking that the place has not been
visited since he was there a thousand years before. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
has numerous impressive experiences, such as seeing a
monk that seems the reincarnation of Jesus, and hearing
again the centurion&rsquo;s call to him. Wallace pictures the
Jew as old, a philosopher, in contrast to Salathiel&rsquo;s impetuous
youth. He is striving to bring the sons of men into
closer spiritual truth with each other and with God, as
Salathiel tries to prevent the material destruction of the
city. The sense of responsibility, the feeling of a mission
toward others, expressed in this novel, may be compared
with that of Eugène Sue&rsquo;s Wandering Jew who acts as a
friend to the Rennepont family, protecting their interests
against the wily Jesuits.</p>

<p>The Wandering Jew has been represented in many
ways, with stress placed on various aspects of his life
and character. He has been depicted psychologically,
as a suffering human being, mythologically to illustrate
the growth and change in life, religiously to preach
certain tenets and beliefs, and symbolically to show
forth the soul of man. He appears symbolically as the
creature accursed of God, driven forever in the face of
doom. Shelley and others show him as vainly attempting
suicide, but living on, anguished yet deathless, in the face
of every effort to take his own life as in the teeth of torture
from others. He stands at once for the undying power
of God&rsquo;s plan, and, as in Robert Buchanan&rsquo;s version, for
the typified failure of Christ&rsquo;s mission. He is used to
prove that Christ&rsquo;s second coming is near, and to prove
also that He will never come. To the Christian he stands
for the evidence of Christ&rsquo;s power of divinity, while to
the Jew he is a symbol of that unhappy race that wanders
ever, with no home in any land.</p>

<p>Besides those mentioned, other English and American
writers who have made use of the legend are Kipling;
Bram Stoker, who discusses him in his assembly of Famous
Impostors; M.&nbsp;D. Conway, who gives various versions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the story; David Hoffman, Henry Seton Merriman, S.
Baring-Gould, W.&nbsp;H. Ainsworth, and others.</p>

<p>A legend closely associated with this and yet separate, is
that of a woman who bore the curse of eternal wandering.
One version brings in Herodias as the doomed woman,
while the character of Kundry in <cite>Parsifal</cite> represents
another feminine wanderer. William Sharp, in his <cite>Gypsy
Christ</cite>, gives the story differently still, saying that it is not
correctly told in <cite>Parsifal</cite>. As Sharp tells it, it is a piece
of tragic symbolism. Kundry, a gypsy woman of evil
life, mocks Christ on Golgotha and demands of Him a sign,
to whom He says, &ldquo;To thee and thine I bequeath the signs
of my Passion to be a shame and horror among thy people
forevermore!&rdquo; Upon her hands and feet appear the
stigmata of His wounds, never to fade away, and to be
borne by her descendants in every third generation.
Various ones of her descendants are crucified, and wherever
the wanderers go on earth they bear the marks of horror.
The curse would be lifted from them only when a Gypsy
Christ should be born of a virgin; but then the Children
of the Wind should be dispersed and vanish from among
men. In the last chapter Naomi prophesies that she is
to give birth to the Gypsy Christ.</p>

<p>The theme of the Wandering Jew, while rivalling the
Faust legend in impressiveness and in the frequence with
which it has been used in literature, yet is different in
having had no adequate representation. No truly great
poem or drama or novel has been written concerning
this tragic, deathless character. Perhaps it may come yet.
Only hints of his personality have appeared in very recent
fiction, such as the reincarnation in the character of the
young Jew in A.&nbsp;T. Quiller-Couch&rsquo;s story, <cite>The Mystery of
Joseph Laquedem</cite>, or the humorous reference to him in
Brander Matthews&rsquo;s <cite>Primer of Imaginary Geography</cite>,
or <cite>The Holy Cross</cite> by Eugene Field, where the wanderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
is pitied by a Spanish priest in Cortez&rsquo;s train in Mexico.
His prayers win forgiveness and the tortured Jew dies.
After his death an earthquake supernaturally splits a
gulf on each side of the grave and a cross of snow appears
there, to remain forever. Perhaps the theme is fading
out now in fiction and drama, to disappear completely,
or perhaps it is lying forgotten for a while, waiting the
master hand that shall give it adequate treatment.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">Elixir of Life.</h3> <p class="inline">Immortality that proves such a curse
in the case of the Wandering Jew forms the basis for
various other stories. The elixir of life was a favorite
theme with the Gothicists, being used by Maturin,
Godwin, and Shelley, and has continued to furnish
complication for fiction since that time. The theme
has been popular on the continent as well as in England,
Balzac and Hoffman being the most impressive users
of it.</p>
</div>

<p>Bulwer-Lytton, in <cite>A Strange Story</cite>, introduces the elixir
of life together with other forms of supernaturalism, such
as mesmerism, magic, spectral apparitions, invisible
manifestations, awful bodiless Eyes, a gigantic Foot, and
so forth. Margrave attempts to concoct the potion that
shall give him endless life, but after mysterious preparations,
incantations, and supernatural manifestations, at
the crucial moment a stampede of maddened beasts,
urged forward by the dreadful Foot, dashes the beaker
from his lips. The irreplaceable liquid wastes its force
on the desert sands, where a magic richness of herbage
instantly springs up in contrast to the barrenness around
it. Flowers bloom, myriads of insects hover round them,
and all is life, but the man who sought the elixir with such
pains lies dead. The author suggests a symbolic meaning
for his story, hinting that the scientist&rsquo;s laboratory holds
many elixirs of life, that all growth and life are magical,
that all being is miraculous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Rider Haggard, in <cite>She</cite> and <cite>Ayesha</cite>, its sequel, describes
a wonderful woman who possesses the secret of eternal
life and has lived for thousands of years, ever young and
beautiful, supernaturally enchanting. Her magic potion
not only gives her length of days but protection against
danger as well, for her rival&rsquo;s dagger glances harmlessly
away from her, and she is proof against chance and fate.
She gains her immortal life partly by bathing in a secret
essence or vapor whose emanations give her mystic force
and immortal beauty. There are many other elements
of supernaturalism in association with the not impossible
She,&mdash;magic vision, reincarnation, a mystic light that
envelops her body, the power to call up the dead, to
reanimate the skeletons in the desert and raise them
to dreadful life. She is an interesting but fearsome personality.</p>

<p>In <cite>Ahrinziman</cite>, by Anita Silvani, we have magic chemistry
yielding up the elixir of life. Jelul-uh-din has lived
for five hundred years and looks forward to a still more
protracted existence. His magic drug not only gives him
prolonged life but will do anything he wishes besides,
since he has hypnotized it. Yet he is found dead. &ldquo;On
his wrists were marks of giant fingers, scorched and burnt
into the flesh like marks of hot iron. And on his throat
were marks of a similar hand which had evidently strangled
him.&rdquo; It is apparent that his master, the De&rsquo;il, got
impatient and cut short the leisurely existence that he
felt belonged to him.</p>

<p>Hawthorne was greatly interested in the theme of the
elixir of life. He gives us two brews of it in <cite>Septimius
Felton</cite>, one an Indian potion concocted by an old sachem.
The red man gets so old that his tribe find him a great
nuisance and obstacle to progress so they gravely request
permission to kill him. But his skull is so hard that the
stone hammers are smashed when they try to brain him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
his skin so tough that no arrows will pierce it, and
nothing seems to avail. Finally they fill his mouth and
nostrils with clay and put him in the sun to bake, till
presently his heart bursts with a loud explosion, tearing
his body to fragments. This brew of his is matched by
one made by an European scientist after long endeavors.
Here the ultimate ingredient is supposed to be a strange
herb that grows from a mysterious grave. At last, just
when the youth thinks he has the right combination, the
woman who has lured him on to destruction dashes the
cup from his lips, saving him from the poison he would
have drunk. The flower has grown from the grave of
her lover, whom the young scientist has murdered.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Dolliver Romance</cite>, that pathetic fragment Hawthorne
left unfinished at his death, we find another treatment
of the theme. It seems symbolic that in his old
age and failing powers, he should have been thinking of
immortal youth, of deathless life. In this story various
magical elements are introduced. The herbs grown in
old Grandsir Dolliver&rsquo;s garden have a strange power,
for when a woman lays a flower from one on her breast,
it glows like a gem and lends a bloom of youth to her
cheeks. The old man seeks the one unknown essence,
the incalculable element necessary to make up the elixir
of life, as did the youth in <cite>Septimius Felton</cite>. He drinks
occasional mouthfuls of a strange cordial that he finds
in an old bottle on the shelf, and seems to grow younger
and stronger. He, too, like Septimius, has a visitor; a
man that demands the cordial as belonging to him by
ancestral right, snatches it from the aged hands, drinks
it down at a draught and grows violently young, but dies
in convulsions.</p>

<p>In <cite>Dr. Heidigger&rsquo;s Experiment</cite> Hawthorne gives us
another sad symbolic story of the quest of the elixir of
youth. The old physician invites four aged friends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
make an experiment, to drink of a cordial which shall
restore youth, but which he himself is too wise to share.
The strange potion proves its power by restoring to beauty
and perfume a rose that has been dead for over fifty years.
When the old persons drink they become young and
happy and beautiful once more. Age drops from them
like a mantle discarded and the world glows again with passion
and color and joy. But alas! it is only ephemeral, for
the effects soon pass away and senility is doubly tragic
after one snatched hour of joy and youth. There is a
sad philosophy of life expressed in these symbolic allegories
such as Hawthorne alone knows how to tell.</p>

<p>Elsewhere Hawthorne shows his deep interest in the
theme. In <cite>The Birthmark</cite> the scientist intimates that he
could brew the life elixir if he would, but that it would
produce a discord in nature such as all the world, and
chiefly he that drank it, would curse at last. The subject
is referred to in other places,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and a flask of the precious,
dreadful elixir is one of the treasures in the Virtuoso&rsquo;s
collection. In a note concerning his use of the theme
in <cite>The Dolliver Romance</cite> Hawthorne states that he has
been accused of plagiarizing from Dumas, but that in
reality Dumas plagiarized from him, since his book was
many years the earlier.</p>

<p>H. G. Wells<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> uses this theme combined with the transfer
of personality. An aged man bargains with a youth
to make him his heir on certain conditions. The purpose,
unknown to the young fellow, is to rob him of his youth
to reanimate the old man. A magic drink transfers the
personality of the octogenarian to the body of youth
and leaves the young man&rsquo;s soul cabined in the worn-out
frame. But the drug is more powerful than Mr.
Elvesham supposed, for it brings death to both who drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
it and the bargain has a ghastly climax. Barry Pain has
a somewhat similar situation of the tragic miscalculation,
in <cite>The Wrong Elixir</cite>, the story of an alchemist who brews
the life-giving potion but means to keep it all to himself.
On a certain night he will drink it and become immortally
young, in a world of dying men. While he waits,
a gypsy girl asks him to give her a poison to kill a man she
hates. He prepares the potion for her and sets it aside.
He drinks at the time he planned, but instead of eternal
life, the draught brings him swift-footed death. Does he
drink the wrong elixir, or have all his calculations been
wrong?</p>

<p>An example of the way in which the magic of the old
fiction of supernaturalism has been transferred into the
scientific in modern times, is seen in <cite>The Elixir of Youth</cite>,
by Albert Bigelow Paine. A man in an upper room
alone is wishing that he had the gift of immortal youth,
when a stranger in black enters and answers his thought.
He tells him that to read the mind is not black magic,
but science; that he is not a magician, but a scientist, and
as such he has compounded the elixir of youth, which he
will give to him. This drug will enable a man to halt his
age at any year he chooses and to make it permanent, as
Peter Ibbetson and the Duchess of Towers did in their
dream-life. The stranger leaves the flask with the man
and goes away. But the one who wished for immortal
life decides that after all God must know best, and,
though his decision not to drink has not crystalized, he
is not greatly sorry when the flask is shattered and the
liquid spilled. This is symbolic of the real wisdom of
life.</p>

<p>The frequent use of the theme of the elixir of life, of
deathless youth, illustrates how humanity clutches at
youth with pathos and shrinks from age. Red Ranrahan,
the loved singer of Ireland, whom W.&nbsp;B. Yeats creates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for us with unforgettable words, makes a curse against
old age when he feels it creeping on him.</p>

<p>Various other stories of supernatural length of years
appear in English fiction, besides those based on the
definite use of the life elixir. <cite>The Woman from Yonder</cite>,
by Stephen French Whitman, shows us the revived, reanimated
body of a woman who has been buried in a
glacier since Hannibal crossed the Alps, till she is dug out
and miraculously restored, by blood-transfusion, by an
interfering scientist. The writer queries, &ldquo;If the soul
exists, where had that soul been? What regions did it
relinquish at the command of the reviving body?&rdquo; A
humorous application of the idea of the deathless man
is seen in A. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s <cite>The Los Amigos Fiasco</cite>,
where the citizens of a frontier town, wishing to kill a
criminal by some other method than the trite rope, try to
kill him by putting him in connection with a big dynamo.
But their amateur efforts have a peculiar effect. They
succeed only in so magnetizing his body that it is impossible
for him to die. They try shooting, hanging, and so
forth, but he has gained such an access of vitality from
electricity that he comes out unscathed through everything,
resembling the ancient sachem in Hawthorne&rsquo;s
novel.</p>

<p>The Flying Dutchman forms the theme for stories in
folklore, of a wanderer of the seas condemned to touch
shore only once in seven years, because he swore he would
round Cape Horn in spite of heaven and hell. Hawthorne
has preserved a letter from the Dutchman to his wife, in
the Virtuoso&rsquo;s collection, and John Kendrick Bangs has
furnished the inevitable parody in his <cite>Pursuit of the Houseboat</cite>.
<cite>The Dead Ship</cite> of Harpwell is another story of a
wandering, accursed ship. There is a similar legend told
by C.&nbsp;M. Skinner,<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> of a man, who, for a cruel murder of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
servant, was condemned to wear always a halter round
his neck and was unable to die.</p>

<p>Bram Stoker furnishes us with several interesting
specimens of supernatural life, always tangled with
other uncanny motives. The count, in <cite>Dracula</cite>, who
has lived his vampire life for centuries, is said to be hale
and fresh as if he were forty. Of course, all vampires
live to a strange lease on life, but most of them
are spirits rather than human beings as was Dracula.
In <cite>The Lair of the White Worm</cite>, Stoker tells of a woman
who was at once an alluring woman and a snake thousands
of years old. The snake is so large that, when it goes out
to walk, it looks like a high white tower, and can gaze over
the tops of the trees.</p>

<p>Bulwer-Lytton&rsquo;s <cite>The Haunters and the Haunted</cite> tells the
story of a mysterious being who passes through untold
years with a strange power over life and the personality of
others. He appears, no man knows whence nor why, and
disappears as strangely, while about his whole career
is a shroud of mystery. Thackeray, in his <cite>Notch on the
Axe</cite>, burlesques this and similar stories in playful satire,
yet seems to enjoy his theme. It is not wholly a burlesque,
we may suppose. He adds a touch of realism to his
humorous description by the fact that, throughout his
hero&rsquo;s long-continued life, or series of lives&mdash;one doesn&rsquo;t
know which&mdash;he retains always his German-Jewish accent.
Andrew Lang describes<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> the person who may have
been the original of these stories in real life. Horace
Walpole has mentioned him in his letters and he seems
to have a teasing mystery about his life and career that
makes him much talked-of.</p>

<p>Edwin Lester Arnold<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> tells a story of continued life with
an Oriental setting and mystery. Edward Bellamy&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<cite>Looking Backward</cite>, by the introduction of a magic sleep
makes a man live far beyond the natural span and be able
to see into the distant future, while the youth in Mark
Twain&rsquo;s <cite>A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur&rsquo;s Court</cite> has
a magic length of life, living a dual existence, in Arthurian
England and in present-day America. H.&nbsp;G. Wells<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> uses
something of the same idea, in that he makes his hero
live a very long time in a few hours, compressing time
into minute tabules, as it were, as he does in another story
of the magic accelerator that makes a man live fast and
furiously with tenfold powers at crucial moments. The
story of Peter Rugg, the Missing Man, is that of another
immortal wanderer, whose story is told in <cite>Myths and
Legends of Our Land</cite>, and utilized by Alfred Austin. He
goes out into a storm, saying, &ldquo;I will see home to-night
or I will never see it!&rdquo; He flies forever pursued by the
storm, never resting, and never seeing his home. This is
symbolic of the haunted soul pursued by its own destiny.</p>

<p>The theme of the elixir of life is one of the old motifs
of supernaturalism retained in modern fiction. The conventional
alchemist has given place to a more up-to-date
investigator in the chemical laboratory, yet the same thrill
of interest is imparted by the thought of a magic potion
prepared by man that shall endow him with earthly immortality.
The theme has changed less in its treatment
and symbolism than most of the supernatural elements in
fiction, for though we see the added elements of modern
satire and symbolism, its essential aspects remain the
same.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">Metempsychosis.</h3> <p class="inline">The idea of metempsychosis, the
thought that at death the soul of a human being may
pass into another mortal body or into a lower stage, into
an animal or even a plant, has been used considerably
in English fiction. This Oriental belief has its basis in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
antiquity, in animistic ideas in primitive culture. One of
the earliest appearances of the theme in English fiction is
that middle-eighteenth-century story of Dr. John Hawkesworth&rsquo;s,<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
an account of a soul that has not behaved itself
seemly, so descends in the spiritual scale till it ends by
being a flea. The German Hoffmann used the theme
repeatedly, and Poe, who was to a certain extent influenced
by his supernaturalism, employs it in several stories. In
<cite>A Tale of the Ragged Mountains</cite>, the young man named
Bedlo experiences, in dreams of extraordinary vividness,
the life of battle, of confusion, ending in death, in a tropical
city. He sees himself die, struck on the temple by a
poisoned arrow. He is recognized by an elderly man as
the exact counterpart of a Mr. Oldeb who perished in the
manner dreamed of in a battle in Benares. Mr. Bedlo,
while wandering in the mountains of Virginia, contracts
a cold and fever, for the cure of which leeches are applied,
but by mistake a poisonous sangsue is substituted for the
leech, and the patient dies of a wound on the temple,
similar to that caused by a poisoned arrow. Poe&rsquo;s concept
in other stories is not that of the conventionally
easy passage of the soul into the body of a new-born babe
that wouldn&rsquo;t be expected to put up much of a fight,
but he makes the psychic feature the central horror,
saying in that connection that man is on the brink of
tremendous psychical discoveries. In <cite>Morella</cite> the theme
is used with telling power, where the wife, once greatly
loved but now loathed, on her deathbed tells her husband
that her child will live after her. The daughter grows
up into supernatural likeness of her mother, but remains
nameless, since her father, for a reason he cannot analyze,
hesitates to give her any name. But at last, as she stands
before the altar to be christened, some force outside the
father causes him to call her Morella.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>What more than fiend convulsed the features of my child,
and overspread them with the hues of death, as, starting at
that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from
earth to heaven, and falling prostrate on the black slabs of
our ancestral vault, responded, &ldquo;I am here&rdquo;!</p>
</div>

<p>The young girl is found to be dead and the father says:
&ldquo;With my own hands I bore her to the tomb; and I laughed,
with a long and bitter laugh, as I found no traces of the
first in the charnel where I laid the second Morella.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An obvious imitation of Poe&rsquo;s story is found in Bram
Stoker&rsquo;s novel, <cite>The Jewel of Seven Stars</cite>, where the soul
of an Egyptian princess enters into the body of a baby
born to one of the explorers who rifle her tomb. The
child grows into the perfect duplicate of the princess,
even showing on her wrists the marks of violence that
cut off the mummy&rsquo;s hand. The Egyptian&rsquo;s familiar, a
mummified cat, comes to life to revenge itself upon the
archæologists who have disturbed the tomb. When by
magic incantations and scientific experiments combined,
the collectors try to revivify the mummy, the body
mysteriously disappears, and the young girl is found dead,
leading us to suppose that the reanimated princess has
stolen the girl&rsquo;s life for her own.</p>

<p>In <cite>Ligeia</cite>, another of Poe&rsquo;s morbid studies of metempsychosis,
the theme is clearly announced, as quoted from
Joseph Glanville: &ldquo;Man doth not yield himself to the
angels nor unto death utterly save only through the
weakness of his own feeble will.&rdquo; The worshipped Ligeia
dies, and in an hour of madness her husband marries
the Lady Rowena. The bride soon sickens and as the
husband watches alone by her bed at midnight, he sees
drops of ruby liquid fall from some mysterious source, into
the wine he is offering her. When the Lady Rowena
presently dies, the husband, again alone with her, sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the corpse undergo an awful transformation. It is
reanimated, but the body that lives is not that of Rowena,
but of Ligeia, who has come back to life again by exerting
her deathless will over the physical being of her rival.
The climax with which the story closes has perhaps no
parallel in fiction. As for the ruby drops, are we to
think of them as an elixir of life for the dead Ligeia struggling
back to being, or as poison to slay the living Rowena?</p>

<p>Ligeia&rsquo;s story is reflected, or at least shows an evident
influence, in <cite>The Second Wife</cite>, by Mary Heaton Vorse.
Here again the dead wife comes to oust her supplanter,
but in this instance the interloper does not die, but without
dying merely <em>becomes</em> the person and the personality of
the first wife. The change is gradual but incontrovertible,
felt by the woman herself before it is complete, and
noticed by the husband and the mother-in-law. Here the
human will, indestructible by death, asserts itself over
mortal flesh and effects a transfer of personality. But
where did the second wife&rsquo;s soul go, pray,&mdash;the &ldquo;she o&rsquo;
the she&rdquo; as Patience Worth would say?</p>

<p>A similar transfer of soul, effected while both persons
are living but caused by the malignance of an evil dead
spirit, is found in Blackwood&rsquo;s <cite>The Terror of the Twins</cite>.
A father, who resents the fact that instead of a single heir
twins are born to him, swears in his madness before he
dies, that before their majority he will bring it to pass
that there shall be only <em>one</em>. By the help of powers
from the Pit he filches from the younger his vitality, his
strength of mind and soul and body, his personality, and
gives this access of power to the elder. The younger
dies a hopeless idiot and the elder lives on with a double
dower of being. Ambrose Bierce carries this idea to a
climax of horror,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> when he makes an evil spirit take
possession of a dead mother&rsquo;s body and slay her son, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
recognizes his loved mother&rsquo;s face, knows that it is her
eyes that glare fiend-like at him, her hands that are
strangling him,&mdash;yet cannot know that it is a hideous
fiend in her corpse.</p>

<p>The theme of metempsychosis is found tangled up with
various other motives in fiction, the use of the elixir of
life, hypnotism, dream-supernaturalism, witchcraft and so
forth. Rider Haggard has given a curious combination of
metempsychosis, and the supernatural continuance of life
by means of the elixir, in <cite>She</cite> and its sequel, <cite>Ayesha</cite>.
The wonderful woman, the dread She-who-must-be-obeyed
who keeps her youth and beauty by means of
bathing in the magic fluid, recognizes in various stages
of her existence the lover whom she has known thousands
of years before. Not having the advantage of the Turkish
bath or patent medicine, he dies periodically and has
to be born all over again in some other century. This is
agitating to the lady, so she determines to inoculate him
with immortality so that they can reign together without
those troublesome interruptions of mortality. But the
impatient lover insists on kissing her, which proves too
much for him, since her divinity is fatal to mere mankind,
so he dies again.</p>

<p>The close relation between metempsychosis and hypnotism
is shown in various stories. Several cases of troublesome
atavistic personality or reincarnation are cured by
psychotherapy. Theodora, a young woman in a novel by
Frances Fenwick Williams, bearing that title-name, realizes
herself to be the reincarnation of a remote ancestress,
an Orientalist, a witch, who has terrorized the country
with her sorceries. She is cured of her mental hauntings
by means of hypnotism. Another novel by the same
author,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> gives also the reincarnation of a witch character
in modern life, with a cure effected by psycho-analysis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
The young woman discovers herself to be the heiress of a
curse, which is removed only after study of pre-natal
influences and investigations concerning the subconscious
self.</p>

<p>As is seen by these examples, the relation between witchcraft
and metempsychosis is very close, since in recent
fiction the witch characters have unusual powers of
returning to life in some other form. In Algernon Blackwood&rsquo;s
<cite>Ancient Sorceries</cite>, we have witch-metempsychosis
on a large scale, the population of a whole village being
but the reanimations of long-dead witches and wizards
who once lived there. I know of no other case of mob-metempsychosis
in English fiction, but the instances
where several are reincarnated at once are numerous.
Algernon Blackwood&rsquo;s recent novel, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jules Le Vallon</cite>, is
based on a story of collective reincarnation, the chief
characters in the dramatic action realizing that they
have lived and been associated with each other before,
and feeling that they must expiate a sin of a previous
existence. Another recent novel by Blackwood, <cite>The
Wave</cite>, has for its theme the reincarnation of the principal
characters, realized by them. Blackwood has been
much drawn to psychic subjects in general and metempsychosis
in particular, for it enters into many of his
stories. In <cite>Old Clothes</cite> he gives us an instance of a
child who knows herself to be the reborn personality
of some one else and suffers poignantly in reliving the
experiences of that long-dead ancestress, while those
around her are recognized as the companions of her life
of the far past, though they are unaware of it. The
fatuous remark of lovers in fiction, that they feel that
they have lived and loved each other in a previous existence,
is a literary bromide now, but has its basis in a
recurrence in fiction. Antonio Fogazzaro&rsquo;s novel, <cite>The
Woman</cite>, is a good example in Italian,&mdash;for the woman feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that she and her lover are reincarnations of long-dead selves
who have suffered tragic experiences together, which
morbid idea culminates in tragic madness.</p>

<p><cite>The Mystery of Joseph Laquedem</cite>, by A.&nbsp;T. Quiller-Couch,
is a striking story of dual reincarnation. A
young Jew in England and a half-witted girl, a farmer&rsquo;s
daughter, recognize in each other and in themselves, the
personalities of a young Jew led to the lions for becoming
a Christian, and a Roman princess who loved him. They
recall their successive lives wherein they have known
and loved each other, to be separated by cruel destiny
each time, but at last they die a tragic death together.
The character of the man here is given additional interest
for us in that he is said to be a reincarnation of Cartapholus,
Pilate&rsquo;s porter, who struck Jesus, bidding Him
go faster, and who is immortalized as the Wandering Jew.
Here he lives successive lives rather than a continuous
existence. Somewhat similar to this is another combination
of hypnotism and metempsychosis in <cite>The Witch
of Prague</cite>, by F. Marion Crawford, where Uorna makes
Israel Kafka go through the physical and psychical tortures
of Simon Abeles, a young Jew killed by his people
for becoming a Christian. By hypnotism the young man
is made to pass through the experiences of a dead youth
of whom he has never heard, and to die his death anew.</p>

<p>There is a close relation between dreams and metempsychosis,
as is seen in certain stories. Kipling&rsquo;s charming
prose idyll, <cite>The Brushwood Boy</cite>, may be called a piece of
dream-metempsychosis, for the youth and girl when they
first meet in real life recognize in each other the companions
of their childhood and adolescent dream-life, and
complete their dual memories. They have dreamed
the same dreams even to minute details of conversation,
and familiar names. Du Maurier combines the two
motives very skillfully in his novels, for it is in successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
dreams that the Martian reveals herself to Barty
Joscelyn telling him of her life on another planet, and
inspiring him to write&mdash;or writing for him&mdash;books of
genius, before she takes up earthly life in one of his children.
She tells him that she will come to him no more
in dreams, but that she will live in the child that is to
be born. And in dual dreams Peter Ibbetson and the
Duchess of Towers live over again their childhood life
together, are able to find at will their golden yesterdays,
and know in happy reality the joys of the past, while
the present keeps them cruelly apart. They are able to
call back to shadowy life their common ancestors, to see
and hear the joys, the work, the griefs they knew so long
ago. They plumb their sub-consciousness, dream over
again their sub-dreams, until they at last not only see
these long-dead men and women, but <em>become</em> them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We could each be Gatienne for a space (though not both of
us together) and when we resumed our own personality again
we carried back with it a portion of hers, never to be lost
again&mdash;strange phenomenon if the reader will but think of
it, and constituting the germ of a comparative personal immortality
on earth.</p>
</div>

<p>Not only does Peter live in the past, but he has the power
to transport these dead ancestors of his to his present
and let them share in his life, so that Gatienne, a French
woman dead for generations, lives over again in an English
prison as Peter Ibbetson, or travels as Mary Towers,
seeing things she never had dreamed of in her own life.</p>

<p>H. G. Wells in <cite>A Dream of Armageddon</cite> gives a curious
story of the dream-future. A man in consecutive visions
sees himself killed. He then dreams that he is another
man, living in a different part of the world, far in the
future, till he sees himself die in his second personality.
He describes his experiences as given in &ldquo;a dream so accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that afterwards you remember little details you had
forgotten.&rdquo; He suffers tortures of love and grief, so that
his dream-life of the future is infinitely more real to him
than his actual existence of his own time. What was the
real &ldquo;him o&rsquo; him,&rdquo; to quote Patience Worth, the man
of the dream-future, or the business man of the present
telling the story to his friend?</p>

<p>A different version of metempsychosis is shown in
<cite>The Immortal Gymnasts</cite>, by Marie Cher, for here the
beloved trio, Pantaloon, Harlequin and Columbine are
embodied as human beings and come to live among men.
Harlequin has the power of magic vision which enables
him to see into the minds and hearts of mortals by means
of &ldquo;cloud-currents.&rdquo; This question of&mdash;shall we say
transmigration?&mdash;of fictive characters into actual life is
found in various stories, such as Kipling&rsquo;s <cite>The Last of
the Stories</cite>, John Kendrick Bangs&rsquo; <cite>The Rebellious Heroine</cite>,
and others. It illustrates the fantastic use to which
every serious theme is sooner or later put. There is no
motif in supernatural literature that is not parodied in
some form or other, if only by suggestion.</p>

<p>The symbolic treatment of metempsychosis is strongly
evident in recent fiction, as the theme lends itself particularly
well to the allegoric and symbolic style. Barry
Pain&rsquo;s <cite>Exchange</cite> shows aspects of transmigration different
from the conventional treatment, for he describes the
soul of the old man as giving up its right to peace that it
might purchase ease for a soul he loved. He passes
into the body of a captive bird beating its hopeless wings
against the bars and tortured with pain and thirst, as a
mark of the witch woman&rsquo;s wrath, while the soul of the
young girl goes into the body of a snow-white lamb that
lives a day then is set free. As she passes by, in the state
of a freed soul, she sees the piteous bird, and says to
herself, &ldquo;I am glad I was never a bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Algernon Blackwood, in <cite>The Return</cite>, gives a peculiar
story of metempsychosis, where the selfish materialist
finds himself suddenly reinforced with a new personality
from without. His eyes are opened miraculously to the
magic and beauty of the world, and he knows beyond
doubt that his friend, the artist, who promised to come
to him when he died, has died and that his soul has become
a part of his own being. The most impressive example
of this sudden merging of two natures, two souls into
one, is found in Granville Barker&rsquo;s <cite>Souls on Fifth</cite>. Here
a man suddenly acquires, or recognizes, the power to see
the souls that linger earth-bound around him, and comes
to have a strange sympathy with that of a woman, whom
he calls the &ldquo;Little Soul.&rdquo; When he speaks of going away,
after a time, she begs him not to leave her since she is very
lonely in this wilderness of unbodied souls. She asks
that if he will not take her into his soul, he carry her
to some wide prairie, and there in the unspaced expanse
leave her,&mdash;but instead he gives a reluctant consent for
her to enter into his life. He presses the little symbolic
figure to his heart, then feels a new sense of being, of
personality, and knows that her soul has become forever
a part of his.</p>

<p>Lord Dunsany, who lends a strange, new beauty to
every supernatural theme he touches, has a little prose-poem
of symbolic metempsychosis, called <cite>Usury</cite>, where
Yohu, one of the evil spirits, lures the shadows to work for
him by giving them gleaming lives to polish.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>And ever Yohu lures more shadows and sends them to
brighten his Lives, sending the old Lives out again to make
them brighter still; and sometimes he gives to a shadow
a Life that was once a king&rsquo;s and sendeth him with it down to
the earth to play the part of a beggar, or sometimes he sendeth
a beggar&rsquo;s Life to play the part of a king. What careth
Yohu?</p>

<h3 class="inline">Spiritualism and Psychical Research.</h3> <p class="inline">The influence
of modern Spiritualism and Psychical Research on the
literature of supernaturalism has been marked, especially
of late years. It would be inevitable that movements
which interest so many persons, among them
many of more than ordinary intelligence, should be reflected
in fiction. These two aspects of the subject will
be treated together since they are closely allied. For
though Spiritualism is a form of religion and Psychical
Research a new science,&mdash;and so-called religion and so-called
science are not always parallel&mdash;the lines of investigation
here are similar. While Spiritualism endeavors
to get in touch with the spirits of the dead that the living
may be comforted and enlightened, and Psychical
Research attempts to classify the supposedly authentic
cases of such communication, and in so much their
methods of approach are different,&mdash;yet the results may
be discussed together.</p>
</div>

<p>Hawthorne was interested in Spiritualism as literary
material, since a discussion of it is introduced in <cite>Blithedale
Romance</cite> and various passages in his notebooks treat of
the matter showing the fascination it had for him. Mrs.
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, in addition to her fictional
treatises of heaven, takes up Spiritualism as well. In
<cite>The Day of My Death</cite> she gives a satiric account of the
return of a spirit who says he is a lost soul tortured in hell.
He doubtless deserves it, for he sticks the baby full of
pins and ties it to a tree, and folds the clothes from the
wash in the shape of corpses. He is still interested in this
life, however, since he requests a piece of squash pie. In
<cite>Kentucky&rsquo;s Ghost</cite> she depicts a spirit actuated by definite
malice. In the previous story seven mediums tell a man
that he will die at a certain day and hour, but he lives
cheerfully on.</p>

<p>William Dean Howells has given a study in his usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
kindly satire and sympathetic seriousness, of the phenomena
of Spiritualism and mesmerism, in <cite>The Undiscovered
Country</cite>. Dr. Boynton, a mistaken zealot, holds seances
assisted by his daughter, a delicate, sensitive girl who is
physically prostrated after each performance and begs
her father to spare her. She acts as medium where the
usual effects of rapping, table levitation, and so forth take
place, where spirit hands wave in the air and messages,
grave and jocular, are delivered. The characterization
is handled with skill to bring out the sincerity of each
person involved in the web of superstition and false belief,
and Howells shows real sympathy with each, the scoffers
as well as the misguided fanatics. It is only when the
doctor looks death in the face that he realizes his error
and seeks to know by faith in the Bible the truths of the
far country of the soul.</p>

<p>Hamlin Garland has shown considerable interest in
Spiritualism in his fiction. He refuses to commit himself
as to his own opinion of the question, but he has written
two novels dealing with it, <cite>The Tyranny of the Dark</cite> and
<cite>The Shadow World</cite>. The former is considerably like
Howells&rsquo;s novel, for here also a young girl is made the
innocent victim of fanatics, her mother and a preacher
who has fallen in love with her. She is made to take part
in spiritualistic manifestations, whether as a victim of
fraud or as a genuine medium the author leaves in doubt.
When the girl casts him off the preacher kills himself that
he may come into closer communication with her after
death than he has been able to do in life. Richard Harding
Davis has contributed a volume with a similar plot, the
exploitation of an innocent and, of course, beautiful girl
by fanatics, in <cite>Vera the Medium</cite>. Here the girl is more
than half aware that she is a fraud and in her last seance,
at the conclusion of which she is to be carried triumphantly
away by her lover, the New York district attorney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
she dramatically confesses her deception. As a sympathy-getter,
she pleads that she was very lonely, that because
her grandmother and mother were mediums, she had been
cut off from society. &ldquo;I used to play round the kitchen
stove with Pocahontas and Alexander the Great, and
Martin Luther lived in our china closet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David Belasco&rsquo;s <cite>The Return of Peter Grimm</cite>, drama and
novel, is based upon spiritualistic manifestations. We
are told that the &ldquo;envelope&rdquo; or shadow-self of a sleeper
has been photographed by means of radio-photography.
When a certain part of the shadow body is pricked with a
pin, as the cheek, the corresponding portion of the sleeper&rsquo;s
body is seen to bleed. Peter Grimm comes back from the
other world to direct the actions of the living, and though
at first only a child sees him,&mdash;for children are the best
sensitives save animals,&mdash;eventually the adults recognize
him also and yield to his guidance. Spiritualism enters
directly or indirectly into many works of fiction of late
years. Whether people believe in it or not, they are
thinking and writing about it. The subject receives its
usual humorous turn in various stories, as Nelson Lloyd&rsquo;s
<cite>The Last Ghost in Harmony</cite>, the story of a specter who
complains of the scientific unimaginativeness of his village,
saying that though he had entreated the spooks
to hold out for a little while as he had heard Spiritualism
was headed that way and would bring about a revival of
interest in ghosts, the spirits all got discouraged and quit
the place. And we recall Sandy&rsquo;s mournful comment to
Mark Twain&rsquo;s Captain Stormfield, that he wished there
was something <em>in</em> that miserable Spiritualism, so he could
send word back to the folks.</p>

<p>The Proceedings of the Psychical Research Society have
a twofold association with literature, for not only have
various modern novels and stories been inspired by such
material, but the instances recorded are similar in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
cases to the classical ghost stories. Lacy Collison-Morley
in his <cite>Greek and Roman Ghost Stories</cite> says, &ldquo;There are a
number of stories of the passing of souls which are curiously
like some of those collected by the Psychical Research
Society, in the Fourth Book of Gregory the Great&rsquo;s
<cite>Dialogues</cite>.&rdquo; The double source of many modern stories
may be found by a comparative study of Collison-Morley&rsquo;s
book and Myers&rsquo;s <cite>Human Personality</cite>, while G.&nbsp;H. Gerould&rsquo;s
volume, <cite>The Grateful Dead</cite>, introduces recent
instances that are like classical stories. The inability of
the soul to have rest in the other world if its body was
unburied, as held by the ancients, is reflected in Gothic
romance, Elizabethan drama as well as in the classics.
The ghost of Jack, whom Peele tells us about, is a case of
a ghost coming back to befriend his undertaker. From
these comparisons it would appear that there is something
inherently true to humanity in these beliefs, for the
revenge ghost and the grateful dead have appeared all
along the line. Perhaps human personality is largely the
same in all lands and all times, and ghosts have the same
elemental emotions however much they may have acquired
a veneer of modernity.</p>

<p>There are many instances of the compact-ghost, the
spirit who returns just after death in accordance with a
promise made in life, to manifest himself to some friend
or to some skeptic. Algernon Blackwood gives several
stories based on that theme, one a curious case where the
ghost is so lifelike his friend does not dream he is not the
living man, and assigns him to a bedroom. Later he is
invisible, yet undoubtedly present, for his heavy breathing,
movements of the covers, and impress on the bed are
beyond dispute. <cite>Afterwards</cite>, by Fred C. Smale, shows a
ghost returning to attend a neighborhood club. When his
name is called by mistake, he takes part on the program,
speaking through the lips of a young man present, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
goes off in a cataleptic trance. During this coma the
youth, who is ignorant of music, gives a technical discussion
of notation, analyzing diatonic semi-tones and discussing
the note a nightingale trills on. When he wakes he says
he has felt a chill and a touch. Alice Brown relates a
story of a lover who promised to come to his sweetheart
at the moment of death, but who, like Ahimeas in the
Bible, runs before he is ready, and keeps his ghostly tryst
while the rescuers bring him back to life. He hasn&rsquo;t
really been drowned at all.</p>

<p>A recent novelette by Frances Hodgson Burnett, called
<cite>The White People</cite>, has psychical phenomena for its
central interest. A little child, born after her father&rsquo;s
tragic death and when her dying mother is conscious of his
spiritual presence, grows up with a strange sensitiveness
to manifestations from the other world. Her home is on a
lonely estate in Scotland, so that her chief companionship
is with the &ldquo;white people,&rdquo; the spirits of the dead, though
she does not so recognize them. Her playmate is Wee
Brown Elsbeth, who has been murdered hundreds of
years before, and she is able to see the dead hover near
their loved ones wherever she goes. So when she comes
to realize what a strange vision is hers, she has no horror
of death, and when her lover dies she does not grieve, but
waits to see him stand smiling beside her as in life. The
theme of the story is the nearness of the dead to the living,
the thin texture of the veil that separates the two worlds.</p>

<p>Basil King tells a poignant story of a soul trying vainly
to return in body to right a wrong done in life but unable
to accomplish her purpose by physical means. At last
she effects it by impressing the mind of a living woman
who carries out the suggestion psychically given. One of
the most effective recent accounts of a spirit&rsquo;s return to
earth to influence the life of the living, to give messages or
to control destiny, is in Ellen Glasgow&rsquo;s <cite>The Shadowy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Third</cite>. Here the ghost of a child, a little girl whom her
stepfather has done to death for her money, returns to
cause his death in an unusual way. She throws her little
skipping-rope carelessly on the stairway where he must
trip up in it when he sees her phantom figure in front of
him in the gloom, so to fall headlong to his death. This is
an impressive revenge ghost.</p>

<p>Henry James based his ghost story, <cite>The Turn of the
Screw</cite>, on an incident reported to the Psychical Society,
of a spectral old woman corrupting the mind of a child.
The central character in Arnold Bennett&rsquo;s novel, <cite>The
Ghost</cite>, is a specter, one of the most rabid revenge ghosts
in literature, who is eaten up with jealousy lest the woman
he loved in life shall care for some one else. Algernon
Blackwood uses much psychical material in his numberless
stories of the supernatural, often mentioning the
work of the Society, and Andrew Lang has contributed
much to the subject. Arthur Machen has just published
a collection of stories of war-apparitions that are interesting
psychical specimens, called <cite>The Bowmen</cite>. In one
story in the volume he shows us how a contemporary
legend may be built up, since from a short piece of fiction
written by him has evolved the mass of material relating
to the angels at Mons. One tale is a story of the supernatural
intervention of Saint George and his army to
drive back the Germans and save the hour for the Allies,
while another describes the vision of a soldier wounded in
battle defending his comrades, who sees the long-dead
heroes of England file past him to praise him for his valor.
The minister gives him wine to drink and</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>His voice was hushed. For as he looked at the minister
the fashion of his vesture was changed. He was all in armor,
if armor be made of starlight, of the rose of dawn, and of sunset
fires; and he lifted up a great sword of flame.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Full in the midst, his Cross of Red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphant Michael brandished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trampled the Apostate&rsquo;s pride.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Another case of collective apparitions is the experience
of a soldier, wounded in battle, who tells of strange
fighters who have come in to aid the English. He thinks
they are some of the tribesmen that Britain employs,
but from his descriptions the minister knows that they
are the long-dead Greeks who have arisen to take part in
the struggle which their modern descendants are reluctant
to share. These stories are only a few among the many
instances of supernaturalism in fiction traceable to the
influence of the war.</p>

<p>Certain volumes of ghost stories have appeared, claiming
to be not fiction but fact, accounts of actual apparitions
seen and snap-shotted. This sort of problematic fiction
is not new, however, since Defoe long ago published
one of the best of the kind, the story of Mrs. Veal, who
appeared to her friend Mrs. Bargrave, and conversed with
her, gravely telling her that heaven is much like the descriptions
in a certain religious book written shortly before
that. She seems very realistic, with her dress of newly
scoured silk, which her friend rubs between her fingers,
and her lifelike conversation. This story has usually been
regarded as one of Defoe&rsquo;s &ldquo;lies like truth,&rdquo; but recent
evidence leads one to believe that it is a reportorial account
of a ghost story current at the time, which missed being
reported to the Society for Psychical Research merely
because the organization did not exist then. The modern
stories that stridently claim to be real lack the interest
in many instances that Mrs. Veal is able to impart, and
in most cases the reader loses his taste for that sort of
fiction because it is rammed down his throat for fact.
They don&rsquo;t impress one, either as fact or as fiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the literature
relating to psychic matters in recent years is the number
of books that claim to be spirit-inspired. These instances
of psychography are not what we might expect immortals
to indite, but it appears that there must be a marked
decrease of intelligence when one reaches the other world.
The messages sent back by dead genius lack the master
style, even lacking that control over spelling and grammar
which low, earth-bound editors consider necessary. But
perhaps the spirits of the great grow tired of being made
messenger boys, and show their resentment by literary
strikes. Anita Silvani has published several volumes that
she claims were written while she was in a semi-trance,&mdash;which
statement no reader will doubt. Her accommodating
dictator furnishes illustrations for her stuff, as well,
for she says she would have inner visions of the scenes
described, &ldquo;as if a dioram passed&rdquo; before her. These
romances of three worlds are quite peculiar productions.
The inner voices asked her in advance not to read any
literature on theosophy or Spiritualism or the supernatural
since they wished her mind to be free from any
previous bias. Mrs. Elsa Barker is another of these
literary mediums, for she has put out two volumes of
letters in narrative form, which she makes affidavit were
dictated to her by a disembodied spirit, the ghost of the
late Judge Hatch, of California. She states that while she
was sitting in her room in Paris one day, her hand was
violently seized, a pencil thrust into it, and the automatic
writing began. Mrs. Campbell-Praed is another of these
feminine stenographers for spooks, but like the rest she
has left nothing that could well be included in a literary
anthology. These spirit-writers tell us of life after death,
but nothing that is a contribution to existing ignorance
on the subject. According to Judge Hatch, whose post-mortem
pen-name is X, the present war has its parallel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in a conflict of spirits, and the astral world is in dire
confusion because of overcrowding, so that the souls of
the slain must go through torments and struggle with
demons.</p>

<p>The most recent instance of psychography comes to us
by way of the ouija-board from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, the authenticity
of which is vouched for by Mr. Casper Yost, of the editorial
staff of the <cite>Globe-Democrat</cite>. But if the ouija-board
dictated the stories and plays, giving the name of Patience
Worth as the spirit author, and if Mrs. Curran took them
down, why does Mr. Yost appear as the author? Patience
Worth says that she lived a long time ago. Mr. Yost
insists that her language is Elizabethan, but it seems
rather a curious conglomeration, unlike any Elizabethan
style I am familiar with. She has written stories, lyrics,
a long drama, and other informal compositions, a marvelous
output when one considers the slow movements
of the ouija-board. The communications seem to have
human interest and a certain literary value, though they
bring us no messages from the Elizabethan section of
eternity.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Automatic writing appears in <cite>The Martian</cite> by Du Maurier,
where the spirit from Mars causes Barty Joscelyn in
his sleep to write books impossible to him in his waking
hours. The type has been parodied by John Kendrick
Bangs in his <cite>Enchanted Typewriter</cite>, which machine worked
industriously recording telegraphic despatches from across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the Styx. The invisible operator gives his name as Jim
Boswell. The writer states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The substance of the following pages has evolved itself
between the hours of midnight and four o&rsquo;clock, during a
period of six months, from a type-writing machine standing
in a corner of my library, manipulated by unseen hands.</p>
</div>

<p>It is astonishing how many ghosts are trying to break
into print these days. And after all, what do the poor
things get out of it? No royalties, scant praise, and much
ridicule when their style fails to come up to specifications.</p>

<p>Interesting psychical material is found in a new volume
of plays by Theodore Dreiser.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> He gives curious twists
to the unearthly, as in <cite>The Blue Sphere</cite>, where a shadow
and a fast mail are among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>, typifying
the fate idea of the old drama. The shadow lures a child
monstrosity out on to the railway track, after he has
caused the elders to leave the gate open, and the train,
made very human, kills the child. The psychic effects
in <cite>In the Dark</cite> are even more peculiar, the characters
including various spirits, a wraith, and a ghost with red
eyes, who circle round the human beings and force them
to discover a murder that has been committed. The
effect of supernatural manifestation on animals is brought
out here, in the bellowing of the bull and the howling of
the dogs as the ghosts pass by. In <cite>A Spring Recital</cite> troops
of nymphs and hamadryads, fauns, clouds of loathsome
spirits of hags and wastrels, &ldquo;persistences&rdquo; of fish, birds,
and animals, &ldquo;various living and newly dead spirits
wandering in from the street,&rdquo; the ghost of an English
minister of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles, who died in 1631, a monk of the
Thebaid, of date 300 and three priests of Isis of 2840
<span class="f8">B.C.</span> enter to hear the organist play. He is unaware that
anybody is hearing his music save the four human beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
who have happened in. These dramas of course are purely
literary plays, impossible of presentation on the stage,
and in their curious character show a likeness to some of
the late German supernaturalism, such as the plays of
August Stramm. They show in an extreme form the
tendency toward psychic material that the American and
English drama has evidenced lately.</p>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline">Life after Death.</h3> <p class="inline">Mankind is immensely interested in
heaven and hell, though he knows but little concerning
these places. But man is a born traveler and gives much
thought to distant countries, whether he definitely expects
to go there or not. This interest is no new thing, for
classical mythology is full of doleful accounts of the after
life. The early English stage represented heaven and
hell in addition to the earth, and Elizabethan drama
shows many references to the underworld, with a strong
Senecan influence. There are especially frequent allusions
to certain famous sufferers in Hades, as Ixion, Tantalus,
Sisyphus, and Tityus. Modern English fiction has likewise
been influenced by the epic supernaturalism, reflecting
the heaven and hell of Dante and Milton. Yet
as in his own thinking each person lays out a Celestial
City for himself and pictures his own inferno to fit his
ideas of mercy and justice, peopling them with appropriate
beings, changing and coloring the conceptions of Bunyan,
for instance, to suit his own desires, so it is in fiction.
Some think of heaven and hell as definite places, while to
others they are states of mind. To some the devil is as
real as in the darkey folk-song, where,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Tearin&rsquo; up de yearth wid his big-toe nail!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">while to others he is an iconoclastic new thought. Heaven
and hell have been treated in every conceivable way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
English fiction&mdash;conventionally, symbolically, humorously,
and satirically, so that one may choose the type he prefers.
There are enough kinds to go around.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the portrayers of the traditional heaven and
hell Mrs. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward is prominent.
Her works on contemporary immortality are said to have
had a tremendous vogue in the period following the Civil
War, when death had claimed so many that the living
were thinking of the other world more than of this. Her
pictures of heaven in <cite>Gates Ajar</cite> are comforting, for she
assures to each person his own dearest wish in fulfillment,
to the ambitious youth his books, to the young girl her
piano, and to the small child her ginger-snaps instead of
earthly bread and butter. In <cite>The Gates Between</cite> the
physician, suddenly killed, finds himself embarrassed by
immortality. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to adjust himself to
eternity and at first brings many of earth&rsquo;s problems with
him. In the third of the series, <cite>The Gates Beyond</cite>, she
describes a very material yet spiritual heaven. Bodies
are much like those on earth, not vaporous projections;
there are museums, hospitals, universities, telephones,
concerts and all up-to-date improvements and conveniences.
The dead woman discovers that she remembers
what she read on earth, takes pleasure in simple things
such as the smell of mignonette, hears the birds sing a
Te Deum, while a brook and a bird sing a duet, and the
leaves are also vocal. There is a Universal Language
which must be learned by each soul, and heaven holds
all sorts of occupations, material, mental, and spiritual.
She says that near earth are many earth-bound spirits
occupied in low and coarse and selfish ways, who
lack &ldquo;spiritual momentum to get away.&rdquo; &ldquo;They
loved nothing, lived for nothing, believed in nothing,
they cultivated themselves for nothing but the
earth,&rdquo;&mdash;which may be compared with the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of the souls on Fifth Avenue, described by Granville
Barker.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward&rsquo;s pictures of heaven may seem sentimental
and conventional to us to-day, yet to be appreciated they
must be considered in relation to the religious thought of
her time. She represented a reaction against the rigid
theology, the stern concepts of an older generation than
her own, and she wished to make heaven more homelike.
She did have an influence in her day, as may be illustrated
by a remark from a sermon recently delivered by
a New York pastor, that the reading of her books had
exerted a great influence over him, that they made heaven
over for him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant is another of the conductors of fictive
Cook&rsquo;s tours through heaven and hell, after the fashion
started by Dante and Milton, and modernized by Mrs.
Ward. She devotes volumes to describing the future
worlds in their relation to mortal destiny. One story<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
tells of a soul that comes back from purgatory to be
comforted by the old minister and sent away happy;
another<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> is the account of a spirit returning from heaven
to right a wrong that her husband is doing another. Still
another<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> gives the experiences of a woman who is distressed
when she finds herself in heaven, because she has
hidden her will and her young niece is thereby left penniless,
but she asks advice of various celestial authorities
and finally succeeds in returning to earth and righting
matters. <cite>A Beleaguered City</cite> is a peculiar story of a
French town besieged by the dead, who drive out the
inhabitants because of their cruelty toward some nuns.
A strange gloom pervades the place, the cathedral bells
ring of themselves, and flaming signs appear on the church
doors, till after much penance the citizens are allowed to
return and the invading hosts from eternity withdraw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
In one story,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Mrs. Oliphant gives her ideas of heaven, as
a place of light, of rest, of joy, of service, where the great
angel Pain helps the souls to wisdom. In a counter-picture,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
she shows hell, the world of the unhappy dead,
where are cruelty, selfishness, suffering, a world filled
with tears that drip from earth. Yet it is a hell as well-regulated,
as thoroughly disciplined as a German municipality,
with various punishments,&mdash;the most terrible
being a lecture platform from which are delivered eternal
addresses.</p>

<p>These would-be-realistic stories of heaven and hell
somehow leave the reader cold, after Dante and Milton,
however much one may feel the sincerity of the authors.
Heaven and hell are such vast provinces that one cannot
chart them in imagination sufficiently to grasp somebody
else&rsquo;s concept in story.</p>

<p>Other stories of life after death, given from the spirit-angle
rather than from the mortal point of view as in
most ghost stories, are among the recent types of supernaturalism.
Alice Brown has several stories of the kind,
in one showing a woman who comes to tell her friend not
to be afraid of dying, because There is much like Here,
and another symbolic of the power of love to come back
even from the pit of blackness after death. Olivia Howard
Dunbar&rsquo;s <cite>The Shell of Sense</cite> gives the psychosis of a
woman who cannot go to heaven because she is jealous of
her husband. She <em>sees</em> the form of the wind, <em>hears</em> the
roses open in the garden, and senses many things unknown
to human beings, yet is actuated by very human
motives. Katherine Butler<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> suggests that death must be a
painless process and the after life much like mortality,
since the man doesn&rsquo;t realize that he is dead but attempts
to go about his affairs as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The symbolic treatment of the theme of life after
death is more effective and shows more literary art than
the conventional pictures of Mrs. Ward&rsquo;s and Mrs.
Oliphant&rsquo;s. No human vocabulary is able to describe
immortality of glory or despair, hence it is more effective
merely to suggest the thought by allegory or symbolism.
Hawthorne gives us a symbolic morality in <cite>The Celestial
Railroad</cite>, where he pictures the road between heaven
and hell, drawing on Bunyan&rsquo;s imagery to describe the
landscape and characters. Apollyon is engineer and
emits realistic blasts of smoke. Eugene Field<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> tells of a
mother just entering heaven who asks an angel where
she may find her little baby, dead long ago, to whom the
angel whispers that she is the babe, grown to maturity
in Paradise. Julian Hawthorne&rsquo;s <cite>Lovers in Heaven</cite> is a
symbolic picture of the after life, where a man just dead
goes in search of the beloved he lost long before. He sees
her on the far slope of a heavenly hill, but before he can
reach her the devil appears to him in his own double,
&ldquo;the Satan of mine own self, the part of me wherein God
had no share.&rdquo; This is a quite modern concept of
diabolism. But love struggles to save him, and he resists
his evil self.</p>

<p><cite>Ahrinziman</cite>, by Anita Silvani, shows lurid pictures of
the world to come. In the Inferno of the Dark Star the
soul sees the attendant genii of his life, each symbolizing
some passion of his nature. There are horrible astral
birds and beasts and combinations unknown to mortal
biology, while vultures hover overhead and a foul astral
odor fills the air. The spirits are of peculiar substance,
for they fight and slay each other, some being torn to
pieces. The soul is supposed to progress toward the Silver
and later the Golden Star. Marie Corelli&rsquo;s <cite>Romance of
Two Worlds</cite> is a queer production, preaching the doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of psychical electricity, which is to be a sort of wonder-working
magician, and in other novels she gives theories of
radio-activity, a theosophical cure-all for this world and
the next.</p>

<p><cite>A Vision of Judgment</cite>, by H.&nbsp;G. Wells, is a satire on
man&rsquo;s judgment of sin and character and of destiny after
death, showing the pettiness and folly of Ahab, proud of
his sins, and the hypocrisy of a so-called saint, conceited
over his self-torture. &ldquo;At last the two sat side by
side, stark of all illusions, in the shadow of the robe of
God&rsquo;s charity, like brothers.&rdquo; The picture of God and
the throne vanish and they behold a land austere and
beautiful, with the enlightened souls of men in clean
bodies all about him. This symbolic allegory setting
forth the shallowness of human judgment as set against
God&rsquo;s clarity of vision and charity of wisdom is like Oscar
Wilde&rsquo;s <cite>The House of Judgment</cite>, a terrible piece of symbolism
expressed in a few words. A soul who has been
altogether evil comes at last before God to be judged.
God speaks to him of his vileness, his cruelty, his selfishness,
to all of which the soul makes confession of guilt.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>And God, closing the book of the man&rsquo;s Life, said, &ldquo;Surely
I will send thee into Hell. Even unto Hell will I send
thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the man cried out, &ldquo;Thou canst not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And God said to the man, &ldquo;Wherefore can I not send thee
to Hell, and for what reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because in Hell I have always lived,&rdquo; answered the man.</p>

<p>And there was silence in the house of judgment.</p>

<p>And after a space God spake and said to the man, &ldquo;Seeing
that I may not send thee into Hell, I will send thee into
Heaven. Surely unto Heaven I will send thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the man cried out, &ldquo;Thou canst not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, never, and in no place, have I been able to
imagine it!&rdquo; answered the man.</p>

<p>And there was silence in the house of judgment.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">The fact that a man&rsquo;s thoughts make his heaven or his
hell is brought out in a recent book, <cite>The Case of John
Smith</cite>, by Elizabeth Bisland, where the central character
receives a revelation while working at his typewriter one
day. The message says, &ldquo;Oh, Peevish and Perverse!
How know you that you have not died elsewhere and that
this is not the Heaven which there you dreamed? How
know you that your Hell may not lie only in not recognizing
this as Heaven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In many recent examples of allegory and symbolism we
get suggestive impressions of the other life, of the soul&rsquo;s
realities. Some of these have the inevitable words,
the fatal phrases that seem to penetrate into the real
heaven and hell for us. The most remarkable instance
of symbolic treatment of the after-life is in <cite>Souls on Fifth</cite>,
by Granville Barker, where the spirits of the dead are
represented as unable to rise above the level of the ideals
they had held in life, and drift endlessly up and down the
Avenue, some in the form of tarnished gilt, some with
white plague spots of cowardice, or blisters of slanderous
thoughts, some horny with selfishness, some with lines of
secret cruelty. There are few squares but mostly irregular
shapes of sin.</p>

<p>The purely humorous treatment of life after death, the
comic pictures of heaven and hell, are of a piece with the
humorous treatment of other phases of supernaturalism,
and are distinctly modern. The flippant way in which
sacred subjects are handled is a far cry from the heaven
and hell of Dante and Milton. Modern writers slap the
devil on the back, make fun of the archangels and appeal
to the ridiculous in one-time sacred situations, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
freedom that would have made the Puritans gasp. For
instance, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter has been the butt of so many jokes
that he is really hackneyed.</p>

<p>The Flying Dutchman, whom Brander Matthews
introduces in his <cite>Primer of Imaginary Geography</cite>, and
who says that the Wandering Jew is the only person he
can have any satisfactory chats with now, speaks of
knowing Charon, &ldquo;who keeps the ferry across the Styx.
I met him last month and he was very proud of his new
electric launch with its storage battery.&rdquo; He says that
hell is now lighted by electricity and that Pluto has put
in all the modern improvements. John Kendrick Bangs,
in his <cite>House-boat on the Styx</cite>, brings together the shades
of many illustrious persons; Queen Elizabeth, Walter
Raleigh, Socrates, Xantippe, Captain Kidd, and many
others. From them we get pictures of the life after death
and of their characteristic attitudes toward it and each
other. He continues the situation in <cite>The Pursuit of the
House-boat</cite>, as the redoubtable Captain Kidd makes off
with the ship and the ladies, leaving all the men behind.
But they follow the bold buccaneer and after exciting
adventures reaching from the Styx to Paris, they recapture
the fair. Carolyn Wells has recently given us a
Styx River Anthology. In modern stories we visit the
comic devil on his native heath, see him in his own home
town, as in previous chapters we discussed him in his
appearances on earth. Kipling&rsquo;s <cite>The Last of the Stories</cite>
shows us the Hades of literary endeavor, the limbo of lost
characters, presided over by a large and luminous devil
of fluent tongue. Kipling recognizes many persons from
fiction, and sees various tortures in process. All do
obeisance to the shade of Rabelais, the Master. Kipling
is terrified by the characters he himself has brought into
being and begs to hide his face from them. F. Marion
Crawford gives us another glimpse of literary eternity,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
where the spirits of learned personages meet and
discuss life. A recent poem describes a meeting and dialogue
in Hades between Chaucer and Cressida.</p>

<p>It is possibly Bernard Shaw who would be most liable
to prosecution by the devil for lèse-majesté, for in <cite>Man
and Superman</cite>, Mine Host of the Pit is represented as an
affable gentleman who tries to make hell attractive to
his guests, and exercises not the least constraint on their
movements. They are free to leave him and go to heaven
if they like,&mdash;he only warns them that they will find it
tiresome. He converses with Don Juan and a couple of
other blasé mortals, uttering Shavian iconoclasms with an
air of courteous boredom. He is very different from the
sinister personage of conventional fiction.</p>

<p>Mark Twain has given humorous views of heaven in his
<cite>Extract from Captain Stormfield&rsquo;s Visit to Heaven</cite>. A bluff,
hearty old salt finds the celestial regions very different
from the traditional descriptions of them. The heavenly
citizens are a polite set, wishful for him to do what he
likes, yet he tires of the things he thought paradise
consisted of, lays aside his harp and crown, and takes his
wings off for greater ease. He finds his pleasures in the
meeting of an occasional patriarch, or prophet, and the
excitement of the entry of a converted bartender from
Jersey City. He changes his views on many points, saying
for instance, &ldquo;I begin to see a man&rsquo;s got to be in his own
heaven to be happy,&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;Happiness ain&rsquo;t a
thing in itself,&mdash;it&rsquo;s only a contrast with something that
ain&rsquo;t pleasant.&rdquo; Again Sandy, his friend, says, &ldquo;I wish
there was something <em>in</em> that miserable Spiritualism so we
could send the folks word about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something of the same combination of humor and
earnestness is found in Nicholas Vachell Lindsay&rsquo;s poem,
<cite>General William Booth Enters into Heaven</cite>.</p>

<p>This combination of realism with idealism, of homely
details with celestial symbolism, is also seen in another
recent poem, <cite>The Man with the Pigeons</cite>, by William Rose
Benet, who shows us two pictures, the first of a tramp in
Madison Square Garden, who loves the pigeons and has
them ever clustering around him in devotion. The next
is of heaven, with the celestial gardens, where among the
goldhaired angels the old tramp stands at home, still
wearing his rusty shoes and battered derby hat. The
quaint commingling of fancy and fact reminds us of
Hannele&rsquo;s dreams of heaven, in Hauptmann&rsquo;s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hannele</cite>,
where the schoolmaster is confused with the angels, and
heaven and the sordid little room are somehow united.</p>

<p>H. G. Wells, in <cite>A Wonderful Visit</cite> shows us another
side of the picture, for he draws an angel down and lets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
him tell the citizens of the earth of the land he comes from.
I make no attempt in this discussion to decide concerning
the personality of angels, whether they are the spirits
of the just made perfect or pre-Adamite creatures that
never were and never could be man. For the present
purpose, they are simply angels. This book of Wells&rsquo;s
is an example of the satiric treatment of heaven and earth
that constitutes a special point of importance in the
modern supernaturalism. It is a social satire, and a
burlesque on the formal and insincere manifestations of
religion. A vicar takes a pot shot at what he supposes is a
rare bird, seeing a rainbow flash in the sky,&mdash;but instead,
an angel comes tumbling down with a broken wing. This
thrusts him upon the vicar as a guest for some time, and
introduces complications in the village life. The parishioners
do not believe in angels save in stained glass windows
or in church on Sunday, and they make life difficult
for the vicar and his guest. The angel shows a human
sense of humor, that quaint philosophy of the incongruous
which is the basis of all true humor, and his naïve comments
on earthly conventions, his smiling wonder at the
popular misconceptions in regard to his heaven&mdash;to which
he is surprised to learn that mortals are thought to go,
since he says he has never seen any there&mdash;make him a
lovable character. But village custom compels him to
fold his shining wings under a coat till he looks like a
hunch-back, put boots on so that he &ldquo;has hoofs like a
hippogrif,&rdquo; as he plaintively says to the vicar, and he finds
conformity to convention a painful process. The novel
ends sadly, symbolizing the world&rsquo;s stupid harshness, for
the angel is sent away from the village as unworthy to
live among the people, and his heart is almost broken.</p>

<p>The same type of humor and satire may be found
in James Stephens&rsquo;s <cite>The Demi-Gods</cite>, and in Anatole
France&rsquo;s, <cite>The Revolt of the Angels</cite>. Stephens&rsquo;s novel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
contains an insert of a short story of heaven previously
published, which depicts a preliminary skirmish
in heaven over a coin a corpse has had left in his
hand and has taken to eternity with him. In each novel
several angels come tumbling down from heaven and take
up earthly life as they find it, engaging in affairs not
considered angelic. Stephens, in addition to the two
fighting celestials, gives us an archangel, a seraph, and a
cherub. There is in both stories a certain embarrassment
over clothes, the fallen ones arriving in a state of nudity.
The necessity for donning earthly garments, the removal
of the wings, and the adaptation to human life furnish
complication and interest, with the added feminine
element, though Stephens&rsquo;s novel is not marred by the
unclean imaginings of Anatole France.</p>

<p>The revolters in the French novel take up Parisian life,
while Stephens&rsquo;s angelic trio join an itinerant tinker and
his daughter who are journeying aimlessly about, accompanied
by a cart and a sad-eyed philosopher, an ass.
They engage in activities and joys not conventionally
archangelic, such as smoking corn-cob pipes, eating cold
potatoes, and, when necessary, stealing the potatoes. The
contrasts between heavenly ideas and Irish tramp life are
inimitable. At last when the three, having decided to go
back to heaven, don their wings and crowns and say
good-bye, the cherub turns back for one more word of
farewell with Mary. Seeing her tears over his going, he
tears his shining wings to shreds and casts them from him,
electing to stay on earth with the tinker&rsquo;s cart, for the
sake of love. It is really quite a demi-god-like thing to do.</p>

<p>Unlike France&rsquo;s book, which is a blasting satire on
religion, these two English novels are amusing, with a
certain measure of satire, yet with a whimsicality that
does not antagonize. France&rsquo;s angels remain on earth
and become more corrupt than men, and Wells&rsquo;s wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
visitor is banished from the village as an undesirable
alien. Stephens&rsquo;s archangel and seraph go back to heaven
after their vacation, while the cherub turns his back on
immortal glory rather than break a woman&rsquo;s heart. In
all three of these books we notice the same leveling
tendency shown in characterization of the angels that we
have observed heretofore in the case of ghosts and devils,
werewolves, and witches. The angels are human, with
charming personality and a piquant sense of humor,
whose attempts to understand mortal conventions reveal
the essential absurdity of earthly ideas in many instances.
The three taken together constitute an interesting case of
literary parallelism and it would be gratifying to discover
whether France was influenced by Wells and Stephens, or
Stephens by Wells and France,&mdash;but in any event Wells
can prove a clear alibi as to imitation, since his novel
appeared a number of years before the others. The
possible inspiration for all of these in Byron&rsquo;s <cite>Heaven
and Earth</cite> suggests an interesting investigation. A more
recent story, <cite>The Ticket-of-Leave Angel</cite>, brings an angel
down to a New York apartment, where he has peculiar
experiences and illustrates a new type of angelic
psychology. The tendency to satirize immortality has
crept even into poetry, for in a recent volume by Rupert
Brooke there are several satiric studies. One, entitled
<cite>On Certain Proceedings of the Psychical Research Society</cite>,
ridicules the idea that spirits would return to earth to
deliver the trivial messages attributed to them, and
another, <cite>Heaven</cite>, is a vitriolic thrust at the hope of a
better life after death, sneering at it with unpleasant
imagery.</p>

<p>One of the recent instances of satiric pictures of the
hereafter is Lord Dunsany&rsquo;s <cite>The Glittering Gate</cite>, a one-act
drama, where Bill and Jim, two burglars, crack the
gate of heaven to get in. Sardonic laughter sounds while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
they are engaged in the effort to effect an entrance, and
wondering what heaven will be like. Bill thinks that his
mother will be there.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if they want a good mother in there who
would be kind to the angels and sit and smile at them when they
sing, and soothe them if they were cross. (Suddenly) Jim,
they won&rsquo;t have brought me up against her, will they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim: &ldquo;It would be just like them to. Very like them.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>When the glittering gate of heaven swings open and the
two toughs enter eagerly, they find nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing but empty space, and the sardonic laughter
sounds in their ears. Bill cries out, &ldquo;It is just like them!
Very like them&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Was not this suggested by Rupert Brooke&rsquo;s poem,
<cite>Failure</cite>?</p>

<p>In the stories treating satirically or humorously of the
future life we find the purpose in reality to be to image this
life by illustration of the other. Eternity is described in
order that we may understand time a little better. Angels
and devils are made like men, to show mortal potentialities
either way. The absurdities of mankind are
illustrated as seen by angel eyes, the follies as satirized
by devils. The tendency now is to treat supernatural
life humorously, satirically or symbolically, rather than
with the conventional methods of the past. Commonplace
treatment of great subjects is liable to be unsatisfactory,
and any serious treatment, other than symbolically
simple, of heaven or hell seems flat after Dante and
Milton.</p>

<p>In considering these various types of stories dealing
with supernatural life, whether continued beyond the
mortal span on earth, renewed by reincarnation, or taken
up in another world after death, we find that several
facts seem to appear with reference to the type chosen for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
treatment by men as distinct from women, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versa</i>. So far as my search has gone, I have found no
instance in English literature where a woman has used
either the motif of the Wandering Jew or the Elixir of
Life. I do not say that no such instances exist, but I have
not found them. Carmen Sylva is the only woman I
know of at all who has taken up the characterization of
the Wandering Jew. On the other hand, women write
often of heaven, most of the stories of conventional ideas
of heaven being by women. Where men have pictured
heaven or hell they have done it for the most part humorously,
satirically or symbolically. They seem to curve
round the subject rather than to approach it directly.
Yet where it is a question of continuing life here in this
world, by means of an elixir or other method, or as an
ever-living being like the Jew, men have used the theme
frequently. Since fiction does reflect our thought-life
and our individual as well as racial preferences, the conclusions
that might be drawn, if one were sure of their
basis, would be interesting. Can it be that men are more
deeply interested in this life on earth and cling to it in
thought more tenaciously than women, and that women
are more truly citizens of the other world? Are men
skeptical of the existence of any but a satiric or symbolic
heaven, or merely doubtful of reaching there?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="stl">The Supernatural in Folk-Tales</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> folk-tale is one of the new fashions in fiction.
True, folk-lore has long constituted an important
element of literature, constantly recurring in poetry,
particularly in the ballad, in the drama, the novel, and
short story. Yet it has been in solution. It has not been
thought important enough to merit consideration for its
own sake, but has been rather apologized for, covered up
with other materials, so that its presence is scarcely
recognized. Now, however, as Professor Kittredge says,
folk-lore is no longer on the defensive, which fact is evident
in fiction as elsewhere. Scholars of our day are
eagerly hunting down the various forms of folk-lore to
preserve them in literature before they vanish completely,
and learned societies are recording with care the
myths and legends and superstitions of peasants. Many
volumes have appeared giving in literary form the fictions
of various races and tribes, and comparative folk-lore
is found to be an engrossing science.</p>

<p>The supernatural forms a large element of folk-literature.
The traditions and stories that come down to us from the
childhood of any race are like the stories that children
delight in, tales of the marvelous, of the impossible, of
magic and wonder. Folk-literature recks little of realism.
It revels in the romantic, the mystic. Tales of gods and
demi-gods, of giants and demons, of fairy-folk, of animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
endowed with human powers of speech and cunning, of
supernatural flora as well as fauna, of ghosts, devils, of
saints, and miracles, are the frame-work of such fiction.
English literature is especially rich in these collections,
for not only are the sections of English-speaking countries
themselves fortunate fields for supernatural folk-tales,
but the English, being a race of colonizers, have gone
far in many lands and from the distant corners of the
earth have written down the legends of many tribes and
nations. This discussion does not take into consideration
primarily folk-tales translated from other languages, but
deals only with those appearing in English, though, of
course, in many cases, they are transcripts from the spoken
dialects of other people. But it is for their appearance
as English fiction, not for their value as folk-lore, that
they are taken up here.</p>

<p>Wherever in fiction the life of the peasant class is
definitely treated, there is likely to be found a good deal of
folk-lore in the form of superstitions, taboos, racial
traditions of the supernatural. This is present to a
marked degree in the stories of Sir Walter Scott, and in
fact one might write a volume on the supernatural in
Scott&rsquo;s work alone. For example, we have Oriental
magic and wonder,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> supernatural vision,<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> superhuman
foreknowledge,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> unearthly &ldquo;stirs,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> the White Lady of
Avenel,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> the bahrgeist,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> besides his use of diabolism, witchcraft,
and so forth already discussed. Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s
work, relating as it does almost wholly to rustic life, is rich
in superstitions and traditions of the peasants. <cite>The
Withered Arm</cite> gives a gruesome account of a woman&rsquo;s
attempt to cure her affliction by touching her arm to the
corpse of a man who has been hanged, the complicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
horror being furnished by the fact that the youth is her
husband&rsquo;s secret son. He gives a story<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> of a supernatural
coach that heralds certain events in the family
life, charms for securing love as for making refractory
butter come when the churn is bewitched, and so
forth. Similar elements occur in others of his novels
and stories. Eden Phillpotts&rsquo; fiction<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> shows a large admixture
of the folk-supernaturalism of the Dartmoor
peasants, as do <cite>Lorna Doone</cite>, <cite>Wuthering Heights</cite> and
numberless other novels and stories of other sections.
There are guild superstitions reflected in the work of
various writers of the sea, as in W.&nbsp;W. Jacobs&rsquo; stories,
for instance, tales of mining life, and so on.</p>

<p>American fiction is equally rich in such material.
Stories of the South, showing life in contact with the
negroes, reveal it to a marked degree, as in the work
of Thomas Nelson Page, Joel Chandler Harris, Ruth
McEnery Stuart, Will Allen Dromgoole, and others. The
Creole sense of the supernatural appears in George W.
Cable&rsquo;s novels and stories, the mountain superstitions
in those of John Fox, Jr., and Charles Egbert Craddock,
those of New England in Mary Wilkins Freeman, Alice
Brown, and their followers, the Indian traditions in Helen
Hunt Jackson, J. Fenimore Cooper, the Dutch supernaturalism
in Washington Irving, who also gives us the
legendry of Spain in his tales of the Alhambra. Thomas
A. Janvier has recreated antique Mexico for us in his
stories of ghosts and saints, of devils and miracles.</p>

<p>In most fiction that represents truly the life of simple
people there will be found a certain amount of superstition
which is inherent in practically every soul. There is no
one of us but has his ideas of fate, of luck, of taboo. We
are so used to these elements in life that we scarcely pay
heed to them in fiction, yet a brief glance at books will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
recall their frequent appearance. They color poetry to a
marked degree. In fact, without the sense of the marvelous,
the unreal, the wonderful, the magical, what would
poetry mean to us? So we should feel a keen loss in our
fiction if all the vague elements of the supernatural were
effaced. Absolute realism is the last thing we desire.</p>

<p>Now the folk-tale, told frankly as such, with no apology
for its unreality, no attempt to make of it merely an
allegory or vehicle for teaching moral truth, has taken its
place in our literature. The science of ethnology has
brought a wider interest in the oral heritage of the past,
linking it to our life of the present. And the multiplication
of volumes recording stories of symbolic phenomena
of nature, of gods, demi-gods, and heroes, of supernormal
animals and plants, of fairies, banshees, bogles, giants,
saints, miracles, and what-not make it possible to compare
the widely disseminated stories, the variants and contrasting
types of folk-supernaturalism. But my purpose
in this discussion is to show the presence of the folk-supernaturalism
in literature, in prose fiction particularly.
There is no science more fascinating than comparative
folk-lore and no language affords so many original examples
of oral literature as the English. As we study its influence
on fiction and poetry, we feel the truth of what
Tylor says<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Little by little, in what seems the most spontaneous fiction,
a more comprehensive study of the sources of poetry and
romance begins to disclose a cause for each fancy, a story of
inherited materials from which each province of the poet&rsquo;s
land has been shaped and built over and peopled.</p>

<p>The Celtic Revival, the renascence of wonder in Ireland,
has done more than anything else to awaken modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
love for antiquity, to bring over into literature the legends
of gods and men</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Beyond the misty space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of twice a thousand years.&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p class="noi">While the movement concerns itself more with poetry
and the drama than with prose,&mdash;Ireland has been likened
to &ldquo;a nest of singing birds,&rdquo; though the voices of some
have been sadly silenced of late&mdash;yet fiction has felt its
influence as well. The land of the immortals glooms and
gleams again for us in storied vision, and the ancient past
yields up to us its magic, its laughter, its tears. These
romances are written, not in pedestrian prose as ordinary
folk-tales, but with a bardic beauty that gives to style the
lifting wings of verse. Each fact and figure is expressed
in poetic symbols, which Yeats calls &ldquo;streams of passion
poured about concrete forms.&rdquo; A sense of ancient, divine
powers is in every bush and bog, every lake and valley.
Ireland has enriched universal fancy and the effect on
literature will perhaps never be lost.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of folk-loristic
supernaturalism is that concerned with nature. The
primitive mind needs no scientific proof for theories of
causation, since, given a belief in gods, it can manage the
rest for itself. With the Celts there is ever a feeling of
nature as a mighty personality. Every aspect, every
phase of her power is endowed with life and temperament.
Celtic pantheism saw in every form a spirit, in every spring
or cloud or hill-top, in every bird or blossom some unearthly
divinity of being. A primrose is vastly more than
a yellow primrose, but one of &ldquo;the dear golden folk&rdquo;;
the hawthorn is the barking of hounds, leek is the tear
of a fair woman, and so on, which poetic speech bears a
likeness to the Icelandic court poetry. This figurative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
sense suggests &ldquo;an <em>after-thought</em> of the old nature-worship
lingering yet about the fjords and glens where Druidism
never was quite overcome by Christianity.&rdquo; It lends to
the Celtic folk-tales their wild, unearthly beauty, their passionate
poetry and mystic symbolism akin to the classic
mythology and such as we find in no other folk-literature
of the present time.</p>

<p>In the stories of Lady Gregory, John Synge, Yeats,
Lady Wilde, and various other chroniclers of Celtic
legendry, we find explanations of many phenomena,
accounts of diverse occurrences. Lady Wilde<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> (Speranza)
tells of natural appearances, such as a great chasm which
was opened to swallow a man who incurred the anger of
God by challenging Him to combat for destroying his
crops. A supernatural whirlwind caught up the blasphemer
and hurled him into the chasm that yawned to
receive him. Many of the aspects of nature are attributed
to the activities of giants, and later of demons; as
the piling up of cyclopean walls, massive breast-works of
earth, or gigantic masses of rocks said to be the work of
playful or irate giants. The titans were frolicsome and
delighted in feats to show off. There is a large body of
legends of diabolized nature, as the changing of the landscape
by demons, the sulphurizing of springs, and the
cursing of localities.</p>

<p>Many other aspects of nature are made the basis for
supernatural folk-tales too numerous to mention. Stories
of the enchanted bird, music, and water appear in various
forms, and the droll-tellers of the Cornish country tell
many stories of the weird associated with out-of-doors.
The Celtic superstitions and tales have lived on through
successive invasions and through many centuries have
been told beside the peat fire. They have been preserved
as an oral heritage or else in almost illegible manuscripts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in antique libraries, from which they are taken to be put
into literature by the Celtic patriots of letters. The sense
of terror and of awe, a belief in the darker powers, as well
as an all-enveloping feeling of beauty is a heritage of the
Celtic mind. It is interesting to note the obstinacy of
these pantheistic, druidic stories in the face of Irish
Catholicism. In many other bodies of folk-supernaturalism
in English we have similar legends of nature, as in the
Hawaiian, the Indian, African, Canadian, Mexican stories,
and elsewhere. But the material is so voluminous that
one can do no more than suggest the field.</p>

<p>Certain forces of nature are given supernatural power in
drama and fiction, as the sea that is an awful, brooding Fate,
in Synge&rsquo;s drama, or the wind and the flame in Algernon
Blackwood&rsquo;s story, <cite>The Regeneration of Lord Ernie</cite>, or the
goblin trees in another of his tales, that signify diabolic
spirits, or the trees<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> that have a strange, compelling power
over men, drawing them, going out bodily to meet them,
luring them to destruction. Blackwood has stressed this
form of supernaturalism to a marked degree. In <cite>Sand</cite>
he shows desert incantations that embody majestic
forces, evocations of ancient deities that bring the Sphynx
to life, and other sinister powers. He takes the folk-loristic
aspects of nature and makes them live, personifying
the forces of out-door life as mythology did. The trees, the
sand, the fire, the snow, the wind, the stream, the sea are
all alive, with personality, with emotion, and definite being.
His trees are more awesome than the woods of Dunsinane,
for they actually do move upon their foe. In <cite>The Sea Fit</cite>
he contends that the gods are not dead, but merely withdrawn,
that one true worshiper can call them back to
earth, especially the sea-gods. The sea comes in power for
the man with the Viking soul and takes him to itself.
His going is symbolic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Uttering the singing sound of falling waters, he bent forward,
turned. The next instant, curving over like a falling
wave he swept along the glistening surface of the sands and
was gone. In fluid form, wave-like, his being slipped away
into the Being of the Sea.</p>
</div>

<p>The uncanny potentialities of fire are revealed<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> where
the internal flame breaks out of itself, the inner fire that
burns in the heart of the earth and in men&rsquo;s hearts. The
artist trying to paint a great picture of the Fire-worshiper
is consumed by an intense, rapturous fever, and
as he dies his face is like a white flame. The snow appears
embodied as a luring woman.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> She tries to draw a man
to his death, with dæmonic charm, seen as a lovely woman,
but a snow demon. Blackwood shows the curious
combination of the soul of a dead woman with the spirit
of a place,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> where a man is ejected by his own estate,
turned out bodily as well as psychically, because he has
become out of harmony with the locale. Nature here is
sentient, emotional, possessing a child, expressing through
her lips and hands a message of menace and warning.
The moon is given diabolic power in one of Barry Pain&rsquo;s
stories, and the maelstrom described by Poe has a sinister,
more than human, power. August Stramm, the German
dramatist, has given an uncanny force to the moor in one
of his plays, making it the principal character as well as
the setting for the action. This embodiment of nature&rsquo;s
phases and phenomena as terrible powers goes back to
ancient mythology with a revivifying influence.</p>

<p>The supernatural beast-tale has always been a beloved
form, Æsop&rsquo;s fables, the beast-cycles of medievalism,
Reynard the Fox, the German Reinecke Fuchs, all show
how fond humanity is of the story that endows animals
with human powers. Naturally one thinks of Kipling&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
<cite>Jungle Tales</cite> and Joel Chandler Harris&rsquo; <cite>Uncle Remus</cite>
stories as the best modern examples, and these are so
well known as to need but mention. Similar beast-cycles
are found in the folk-fiction of other countries.
Of course, it is understood that the <cite>Uncle Remus</cite> stories
are not native to America, but were brought from Africa
by the slaves and handed down through generations in the
form in which Harris heard them by the cabin firesides in
his boyhood. They are not &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; or edited any more
than he could help, he tells us, but given in the dialectic
form in which they came to him. There are various tales
similar to this series, as Kaffir tales, collected by Theal,
Amazonian tortoise myths brought together by Charles F.
Hart, and <cite>Reynard, the Fox in South Africa</cite>, by W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;I.
Bleek. J.&nbsp;W. Powell in his investigations for the Smithsonian
Institute found legends among the Indians that led
him to believe the <cite>Uncle Remus</cite> stories were originally
learned from the red men, but Harris thought there was
no basis for such theory. <cite>Anansi Stories</cite>, by Mary
Pamela Milne-Horne, includes animal tales of the African
type. Anansi is a mysterious being, a supernatural old
man like a Scandinavian troll or English lubber-fiend, who
plays tricks like those of the fox and like the jackal in
Hindu stories. He is a spider as well as a man and can
assume either shape at will.</p>

<p>In primitive races and in the childhood of peoples
there is the same element of close association between
man and the animals that one finds in child-life. An
animal is often nearer and dearer to a child than is a human
being, as in crude races man is more like the animals,
candid, careless, unreflecting. His sensations and emotions
are simple, hunger, love, hate, fear. Animals, in
turn, are lifted nearer the human in man&rsquo;s thinking, and
are given human attributes in folk-lore which bridges
the gulf that civilization has tended to fix between man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and animals, and gives one more of a sense of the social
union that Burns longed for. There is in these stories of
whatever country a naïveté reflecting the childhood of the
race and of the world, a primitive simplicity in dealing
with the supernatural.</p>

<p>The folk-fiction of each country gives stories of the
animals common to that section. In tropic countries
we have stories of supernatural snakes, who appear in
various forms, as were-snakes, shall we say? by turns
reptiles and men, who marry mortal women, or as diabolic
creatures that, like the devil, lose their divinity and become
evil powers. We also see in the tropics elephants, lions,
tigers, baboons, gorillas, and so forth, as well as certain
insects, while in colder climes we have the fox, the wolf,
the bear, and their confrères. In island countries we find
a large element of the supernatural associated with fishes
and sea-animals. Hawaiian stories recount adventures
of magic beings born of sharks and women, who are
themselves, by turns, human beings living a normal human
life, and sharks, devouring men and women. Several of
Eugene Field&rsquo;s stories are drawn from Hawaiian folk-supernaturalism,
as <cite>The Eel-king</cite>, and <cite>The Moon Lady</cite>.</p>

<p>The Gaelic stories of Fiona McLeod show the supernatural
relation existing between mortals and seals.
The seals may wed human beings and their children are
beings without souls, who may be either mortal or animal.
The power of enchantment exercised by the creatures of
the sea may turn men and women into sea-beasts, forever
to lose their souls. This may be compared with <cite>The Pagan
Seal-Wife</cite>, by Eugene Field, Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s
sad story of the little mermaid, and <cite>The Forsaken Merman</cite>,
by Matthew Arnold. Fiona McLeod tells the story of the
Dark Nameless One, a nun who became the prey of a seal
and was cursed with the penalty of living under the sea
to weave fatal enchantments. The mermaids, the kelpies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the sea-beasts are all half-human, half sea-beast,
and have a fatal power over human souls, drawing them
with a strange lure to give up their immortality. The
kelpie appears in several of Fiona McLeod&rsquo;s stories and
in <cite>The Judgment of God</cite> the maighdeanhmara, a sea-maid,
bewitches Murdoch, coming up out of the water as a
seal and turning him into a beast, to live with her forever,
a black seal that laughs hideously with the laughter of
Murdoch. Edward Sheldon has recently written a play<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
using the mermaid motif, and H.&nbsp;G. Wells employs it as a
vehicle for social satire<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> where a mermaid comes ashore
from The Great Beyond and contrasts mortal life with
hers. <cite>The Merman and the Seraph</cite>, by William Benjamin
Smith, is an unusual combination of unearthly creatures.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Old Men of the Twilight</cite>, W.&nbsp;B. Yeats describes
the enchantment inflicted on the old men of learning,
the ancient Druids, who were cursed by being turned into
gray herons that must stand in useless meditation in
pools or flit in solitary flight cross the world, like passing
sighs. Lady Gregory tells of magic by which Lugh of the
Long Hand puts his soul into the body of a mayfly that
drops into the cup that Dechtire drinks from, so that she
drinks his soul and must follow him to the dwelling-place
of the Sidhe, or fairy people. Her fifty maidens must go
with her under a like spell that turns them into birds,
that fly in nine flocks, linked together two by two with
silver chains, save those that lead who have golden chains.
These beautiful birds live in the enchanted land far away
from their loved ones. J.&nbsp;H. Pearce tells a touching story
of the Little Crow of Paradise, of the bird that was cursed
and sent to hell because it mocked Christ on the cross,
but because it had pity on a mortal sufferer in hell and
brought some cooling drops of water in its bill to cool his
parching tongue, it was allowed to fly up and light on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
walls of Paradise where it remains forever. Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s
story <cite>The Nightingale and the Rose</cite> is symbolic of tragic
genius, of vain sacrifice, where the tender-hearted bird
gives his life-blood to stain a white rose red because a
careless girl has told the poet who loves her that she must
wear a red rose to the ball. But at the last she casts the
rose aside and wears the jewels that a richer lover has sent,
while the nightingale lies dead under the rose-tree.</p>

<p>So we see everywhere in folk-fiction the supernatural
power given to animals, which acts as an aid to man, as
a shield and protection for him, or for his undoing. We
see human beings turned into beasts as a curse from the
gods for sin or as expressing the kinship between man and
nature. In the different cycles of beast-tales we find a
large element of humor, the keener-witted animals
possessing a rare sense of the comical and relishing a joke
on each other as on man. The <cite>Uncle Remus</cite> stories are
often laughable in the extreme, and Bre&rsquo;er Rabbit,
who, we might at first thought decide, would be stupid,
is no mean wit. We see a tragic symbolism in the stories
of unhappy beasts who must lure mortals to their damnation,
yet feel a sense of human sorrow and remorse. In
these animal stories we find most of the significant qualities
of literature, humor, romance, tragedy, mysticism,
and symbolic poetry, with a deep underlying philosophy
of life pervading them all.</p>

<p>Lord Dunsany in his modern aspects of mythology,
perhaps drawn in part from classic mythology though
perhaps altogether Celtic in its material, brings together
animals to which we are not accustomed. He has a story
of a centaur, a frolicsome creature two hundred and fifty
years young, who goes caracoling off the end of the world
to find his bride. Algernon Blackwood tells of a man who
remembers having been a centaur and lives in memory-metempsychosis
his experiences of that far-off time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Dunsany introduces other curious, unfamiliar beasts to
us, as the bride whom the man-horse seeks in her temple
beside her sad lake-sepulchre, Sombelene, of immortal
beauty, whose father was half centaur and half god,
whose mother the child of a desert lion and the sphinx.
There is the high-priest of Maharrion, who is neither
bird nor cat, but a weird gray beast like both. There
is the loathsome dragon with glittering golden scales
that rattles up the London streets and seizes Miss Cubbige
from her balcony and carries her off to the eternal
lands of romance lying far away by the ancient, soundless
sea. We must not forget the Gladsome Beast, he who
dwells underneath fairyland, at the edge of the world,
the beast that eats men and destroys the cabbages of the
Old Man Who Looks after Fairyland, but is the synonym
for joy. His joyous chuckles never cease till Ackronnion
sings of the malignity of time, when the Gladsome Beast
weeps great tears into an agate bowl. There are the
hippogriffs, dancing and whirling in the far sunlight,
coming to earth with whirring flight, bathing in the pure
dawn, one to be caught with a magic halter, to carry its
rider past the Under Pits to the City of Never. There are
the gnoles in their high house, whose silence is unearthly
&ldquo;like the touch of a ghoul,&rdquo; over which is &ldquo;a look in the
sky that is worse than a spoken doom,&rdquo; that watch the
mortals through holes in the trunks of trees and bear
them away to their fate. Lord Dunsany looses the reins
of his fancy to carry him into far, ancient lands, to show
us the wonders that never were.</p>

<p>Magic forms an alluring element of the supernatural
romance, and we find it manifesting itself in many ways.
In the romances of William Morris, prose as well as poetry,
we find enchantment recurring again and again, as in
<cite>The Water of the Wondrous Isles</cite>, <cite>The Wood beyond the
World</cite>, <cite>The Well at the World&rsquo;s End</cite>, and others. Yeats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
said that Morris&rsquo;s style in these old stories was the most
beautiful prose he had ever read, and that it influenced
his own work greatly. He has unearthly characters,
such as the Witch-wife, the Wood-wife, the Stony
People, and so forth. He shows us the enchanted boat,
the Sending Boat, the cage with the golden bars which
prison the three maidens, magic runes with mighty
power, the Water of Might which gives to the one drinking
it supernatural vision and magic power, the changing
skin, the Wailing Tower, the Black Valley of the Greyweathers,
and so forth. Birdalone&rsquo;s swoon-dream in the
White Palace is unearthly, as the witches&rsquo; wordless howls.
Part of the weirdness of Morris&rsquo;s prose is due to the
antique tone, the forgotten words, the rune-like quality
of the rhythm.</p>

<p>Yeats tells of magic whereby a woman is gifted with
immortal youth and beauty, so that she may wed the
prince of the fairies; of the glamour that falls on a mortal
so that he loses his wits and remains &ldquo;with his head on his
knees by the fire to the day of his death&rdquo;; of shadow
hares, of fire-tongued hounds that follow the lost soul
across the world, of whistling seals that sink great ships,
of bat-like darker powers, of the little gray doves of the
good.</p>

<p>Dr. Hyde, in his <cite>Paudeen O&rsquo;Kelly and the Weasel</cite>, speaks
of a sun-myth, of a haunted forest, of a princess supernaturally
beautiful, of the witch who complains to the
robber, &ldquo;Why did you bring away my gold that I was for
five hundred years gathering through the hills and hollows
of the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Gregory tells of Diarmuid&rsquo;s love-spot, where
Youth touched him on the forehead, so that no woman
could look upon him without giving him her love; of
Miach who put the eye of a cat in a man&rsquo;s head, with
inconvenient results, for</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">when he wanted to sleep and take his rest, it is then the eye
would start at the squeaking of the mice, or the flight of birds,
or the movement of the rushes; and when he was wanting to
watch an army or a gathering, it is then it was sure to be in a
sound sleep.</p>
</div>

<p>She shows us Druid rods that change mortals into birds;
of Druid mists that envelop armies and let the ancient
heroes win; of Druid sleep that lasts sometimes for years;
of the screaming stone; of kisses that turn into birds,
some of them saying, &ldquo;Come! Come!&rdquo; and others &ldquo;I go!
I go!&rdquo;; of invisible walls that shield one from sight; of
magic that makes armies from stalks of grass; of wells of
healing that cure every wound.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde, in his fairy stories and symbolic allegories,
tells of magic, whereby the Happy Prince, high on the
pedestal on the square, has a heart of lead because he
sees the misery of the people, and sends a swallow as his
messenger to pick out his jeweled eyes and take them to
the suffering ones. He speaks of the wonder by which
the bodies of the mermaid and the fisherman who lost his
soul for love of her, when they are buried in unconsecrated
ground, send forth strange flowers that are
placed on the sacred altar.</p>

<p>The dark enchantment appears in the poetry as often as
in the prose, from Coleridge&rsquo;s <cite>Christabel</cite> to the present.
Gordon Bottomley&rsquo;s <cite>The Crier by Night</cite> is a story of an
evil presence that lurks in a pool, coming out to steal the
souls of those it can lure into its waters. The woman,
desperate from jealousy, who invokes its aid, says:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;For I can use this body worn to a soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To barter with the Crier of hidden things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if he tangle him in his chill hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I will follow and follow and follow and follow<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Past where the ringed stars ebb past the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn to water under the dark world!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The fairy has always been a favorite being with poets,
dramatists, and romancers, from Shakespeare, Spenser,
and Milton to the present time. There is no figure more
firmly established in folk-literature, none more difficult
to dislodge despite their delicacy and ethereal qualities
than the Little People. The belief in fairies is firmly
established in Gaelic-speaking sections and the Celtic
peasant would as soon give up his religion as his belief
in the Sidhe. W.&nbsp;B. Yeats, in <cite>Celtic Twilight</cite>, tells of an
Irish woman of daring unbelief in hell, or in ghosts who,
she held, would not be permitted to go trapsin&rsquo; about the
earth at their own free will, but who asserted, &ldquo;There are
fairies, and little leprechauns, and water-horses, and
fallen angels.&rdquo; Everybody among the peasantry believes
in fairies, &ldquo;for they stand to reason.&rdquo; And there are not
wanting others more learned that believe in the small
folk, as W.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;E. Wentz, who in his volume <cite>Fairy Faith
in Celtic Countries</cite> puts up a loyal argument for the
existence of the Sidhe. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Fairies exist, because in all essentials they appear to be
the same as the intelligent forces now recognized by psychological
researchers, be they thus collective units of consciousness
like what William James calls soul-stuff or more individual
units like veridical apparitions.</p>
</div>

<p>If it were left to me, I&rsquo;d as soon not believe in fairies as
have to think of them as veridical units! Mr. Wentz
has never seen any fairies himself, but he tells a number of
stories to substantiate his faith in them.</p>

<p>The volumes of fairy stories are by no means all for
juvenile consumption, since the modern adult dearly
loves the type himself. Many, or most, of the stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
fairies told frankly for children are adaptations or variants
of continental folk-legends. The more literary side of
fairy-literature has come from the Celtic lore, for the
Dim People are dearest of all supernatural beings to the
Celtic soul. The Irish, more innately poetic than most
races, cling more fondly to the beings of beauty and gather
round them delicate, undying stories. W.&nbsp;B. Yeats,
Lady Gregory, Lady Wilde, Oscar Wilde, John Singe, and
Fiona McLeod have given in poetry and lyric prose the
Celtic fairy-lore, and have made us know the same wild,
sweet thrill that the peasants feel. The poetic thought
of the primitive races peoples everything in nature, every
bird and blossom and tree, with its own fairy personality.</p>

<p>Thackeray has written a fairy pantomime for great
and small children, as he says, in which the adventures
of Prince Giglio and Prince Bulbo are recounted. Eugene
Field has a charming story of the <cite>Fairies of Pesth</cite>, and
Charles Kingsley&rsquo;s <cite>Water Babies</cite> enriched the imagination
of most of us in youthful or adult years with its charming
nonsense of beings possible and impossible. J.&nbsp;M.
Barrie in <cite>Peter Pan</cite> won the doubtful world over to a
confessed faith in the fairy-folk, for did we not see the
marvels before our eyes? In <cite>The Little White Bird</cite> Barrie
tells us how fairies came to be,&mdash;that they have their
origin in the first laugh of the first baby that broke into a
million bits and went skipping about, each one a fairy.
He shows us the wee folk in Kensington Gardens, where
by the ignorant they are mistaken for flowers, but children
and those with the poet heart can see the flashing faces
and green garments of the fairies among the pansy beds.</p>

<p>W.&nbsp;B. Yeats is a favorite with the fairies, for they have
given him the dower of magic vision, to glimpse the
unseen things, to hear the faint, musical voices of fairy
pipes and song. He tells us many stories of the Dim
People, in his tales and dramas. <cite>The Land of Heart&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Desire</cite>, the story of the struggle between the divine and
mortal forces and the powers of the Sidhe to claim the
soul of the young wife and of the triumph of the fairies,
by which the girl&rsquo;s body falls lifeless by the hearth while
her spirit speeds away to live forever in the land &ldquo;where
nobody gets old or sorry or poor,&rdquo; has a poignant pathos,
a wild, dreamy beauty that touches the heart. Yeats
tells of the Imperishable Rose of Beauty, of fantastic
doings of the fairy-folk who steal mortals away, especially
new-born babies or new-wed brides, of evil fairies who
slay men in malice, and of the dances by moonlit hillside
when mortals are asleep.</p>

<p>James Stephens in <cite>The Crock of Gold</cite> mingles delightfully
fairy-lore with other elements of the supernatural,
as talking beasts, and insects, the gods, a leprechaun, and
Pan, combining with the droll philosophy of the bachelor
man to make a charming social satire. The union of the
world of reality with that of the wee people is seen in the
sad little story of H.&nbsp;G. Wells, <cite>The Man Who Had Been
in Fairyland</cite>. A crude, materialistic middle-class Englishman,
in love with an ordinary young woman, falls asleep
on a fairy knoll one night and is kidnapped by the Dim
People who take him to their country, where their queen
falls in love with him. She vainly woos him, but he is
stolidly true to the thick-ankled girl of the town, until
the fairies send him back in sleep to mortal life. But
when he wakes on the knoll he is home-sick for fairyland,
he cares no more for the village girl who seems coarse and
repulsive compared with the elfin creature whose love he
might have kept in the land of wonder, so he is wretched,
unable to fit again into mortal life and unable to reopen
the doors that closed inexorably upon him by his wish.
This is a modern version of the motif of the mortal lover
and the fairy bride that we find so often in mediæval ballads
and romances, a survival of the Celtic wonder-lore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Arthur Lewis in <cite>London Fairy Tales</cite> writes philosophic
human stories in the guise of fairy tales, attempting
frankly to bring the impossible into contact with daily
life. They are weird little symbolic stories with an earthly
wisdom associated with unearthly beings. <cite>The Passionate
Crime</cite>, by E. Temple Thurston, is a symbolic fairy
novel, the fairies being figures of the man&rsquo;s besetting sins,
bodiless presences blown on the winds of feeling, as the
woman he loves is lured by the fairy of her own beauty.</p>

<p>Whether fairyland be an actual place or a state of
mind, it is a province still open to romancers, and folklorists
have aroused a new interest in the Little People
who may come nearer to us than before. The flood of
volumes recounting Celtic folk-tales with their fairy-lore
alone would make a long catalogue, and one can do no
more than suggest the presence of the fairy in English
fiction. Andrew Lang was a faithful lover of the Sidhe
and made many collections of fairy stories, Eden Phillpotts
has written much of them, and various writers have
opened their magic to us. Some place the land of faerie
under the ground, some in secret caves, some in the mind,
and Lord Dunsany says that the Old Man Who Looks
after Fairyland lives in a house whose parlor windows
look away from the world, and &ldquo;empties his slops sheer
on to the Southern Cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We find many stories of gods, demigods, and heroes
tangled up together in folk-tales and in the literature they
have influenced. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish
between them, and again it is interesting to note how the
hero-myth has been converted into the tale of a god.
Celtic romances and folk-supernaturalism give many
stories of gods, demigods, and heroes of superhuman
force. It would be interesting if one could trace them to
their ultimate sources and discover how much they have
been suggested or influenced by classical mythology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
In <cite>Fiction of the Irish Celts</cite>, by Patrick Kennedy, are
numberless stories of the Fianna Eironn, or Heroes of
Ireland, some of whom really flourished in the third
century and whose adventures were the favorite stories
of the kings and chiefs as sung by the ancient bards.
Kennedy also retells many of the Ossianic legends. In
<cite>Bardic Stories of Ireland</cite> he relates the exploits of personages
dating back to druidic times and earlier, who
reflect the remote stages of the legendary history of the
people, such as the antique King Fergus, who was given
supernatural power by the fairies and slew the sea-monster;
Cormac, who did many doughty deeds assisted
by the powers of the Immortals, and many others. W.
B. Yeats, in his <cite>Stories of Red Ranrahan</cite>, gives us glimpses
of an Irish François Villon, a man of wandering nature,
of human frailties, yet with a divine gift of song.</p>

<p>Lady Gregory tells the wonderful saga of Cuchulain,
the hero-god of Ireland, in <cite lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Cuchulain of Muirthemne</cite>,
which W.&nbsp;B. Yeats calls &ldquo;perhaps the best book that has
ever come out of Ireland.&rdquo; It was his mother Dechtire
that drank the soul of Lugh of the Strong Hand, as he
flew into her wine-cup in the form of a Mayfly, so that
she was bound by enchantment and carried away with
her fifty maidens as a flock of lovely birds. When anger
came upon him the hero light would shine about his head,
he understood all the arts of the druids and had supernatural
beauty and strength in battle. Cuchulain, the
Hound of Ulster, and his Red Branch have filled the
legendry of Ireland with wonder.</p>

<p>Lady Gregory tells of the high king of Ireland who
married Etain of the Sidhe; of the nine pipers that came
out of the hill of the Sidhe, whom to fight with was to
fight with a shadow, for they could not be killed; of
Conchobar, the king, that loved Deirdre of the burning
beauty for whom many candles of the Gael were blown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
out; of Cruachan, who knew druid enchantments greater
than the magic of the fairies so that he was able to fight
with the Dim People and overcome them, and to cover
the whole province with a deep snow so that they could
not follow him. In <cite>Gods and Fighting Men</cite> Lady Gregory
tells of ancient divinities that met men as equals. We
come to know Oisin, son of Finn, who is king over a divine
country; of the Men of Dea who fought against the misshapen
Fomer. Men are called to the country of Under-Wave
where the gods promise them all their desires, as the
god Medhir tells Queen Etain that in his country one
never grows old, that there is no sorrow, no care among
invisible gods. She tells us of Finn, who fought with
monsters, who killed many great serpents in Loch Cuilinn,
and Shadow-shapes at Loch Lein, and fought with the
three-headed hag, and nine headless bodies that raised
harsh screeches. We meet Diarmuid, who married a
daughter of King Under-Wave, who raised a house by enchantment,
and whom Grania, of the fatal beauty, loved.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Curtin, Aldis Dunbar, and many another
writer have told us of the wonderful legends of the Celtic
gods and heroes, who somehow seem more human than
Arthur and his Table Round or any of the English mythical
heroes.</p>

<p>It is Lord Dunsany, however, who specializes in gods in
recent times. He fairly revels in divinities and demons,
in idols and out-of-the-world creatures. His dramas of
this nature are mentioned in another connection, as <cite>A
Night at an Inn</cite>, where a jade idol slays with silent horror
the men who have stolen his emerald eye; <cite>The Gods of the
Mountains</cite>, where seven beggars masquerade as the
mountain gods come to life, and some of the people believe
but some doubt. But at last the seven gods from the
mountain come down, terrible figures of green stone, and
with sinister menace point terrible fingers at the beggars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
who stiffen as on pedestals, draw their feet under them
like the cross-legged posture of the images, and turn to
stone, so that the people coming say: &ldquo;They were the
true gods. They have turned to stone because we doubted
them.&rdquo; In <cite>The Gods of Pegana</cite> are many fantastic tales
of divinities never heard of before, whom Dunsany calls
to life with the lavish ease of genius and makes immortal.
In <cite>Time and the Gods</cite> we see many gods, with their servant
the swart, sinister Time who serves them, but maliciously.
The gods dream marble dreams that have magic power,
for &ldquo;with domes and pinnacles the dreams arose and stood
up proudly between the river and the sky, all shimmering
white to the morning.&rdquo; But Sardathrion, this city of
visions, is overthrown by hateful Time, whereat the
mighty gods weep grievous tears. He tells us of Slid, a
new god that comes striding through the stars, past where
the ancient divinities are seated on their thrones, as a
million waves march behind him; of Inzana, the daughter
of all the gods who plays with the sun as her golden ball
and weeps when it falls into the sea, so that Umborodom
with his thunder hound must seek it again and again for
her. He whispers to us of the prophet who saw the
gods one night as they strode knee-deep in stars, and
above them a mighty hand, showing a higher power.
The gods are jealous of him that he has seen, so they rob
him of knowledge of the gods, of moon and sky, of butterflies
and flowers, and all lovely things. And last they steal
his soul away from him, from which they make the South
Wind, forever to roam the waste spaces of the world,
mournful, unremembering.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Book of Wonder</cite> are still other gods, as Hlo-Hlo,
who wears the haloes of other gods on golden hooks along
his hunting-belt; the Sphinx, who &ldquo;remembers in her
smitten mind at which little boys now leer, that she once
knew well those things at which man stands aghast&rdquo;;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the certain disreputable god who knows nothing of etiquette
and will grant prayers that no respectable god
would ever consent to hear; Chu-chu and Sheemish, who
become angry with each other and raise rival earthquakes
that destroy their temple and them. We are
told of the Gibbelins that eat men, whose home is beyond
the known regions, and whose treasures many burglars
try in vain to steal only to meet death instead. Alderic
tries a crafty way to evade them but they are waiting for
him. &ldquo;And without saying a word <em>or even smiling</em> they
neatly hang him on the outer wall,&mdash;and the tale is one
of those that have not a happy ending.&rdquo; But enough of
gods!&mdash;though we should not forget the Aztec legend
on which Lew Wallace&rsquo;s novel, <cite>The Fair God</cite>, was founded,
of the white divinity who was to come and rule the people.</p>

<p>There are many other elements of folkloristic supernaturalism
that cannot be mentioned, as the banshee, the
wailful creature that is a presager of death and the loss of
the soul; the fetches, ghosts of the living, whom John and
Michael Banim write much about; the pixies, as appearing
in such works as S. Baring-Gould&rsquo;s <cite>Eve</cite>, and Stephens&rsquo;s
<cite>The Crock of Gold</cite>; the mountain trolls that play pranks on
Ibsen&rsquo;s Peer Gynt and Irving&rsquo;s Rip van Winkle; the
&ldquo;worrie-cow&rdquo; that Scott tells about; the saints and
miracles that abound in Celtic literature as in that of any
Catholic country, and such as Thomas A. Janvier has told
of so delightfully in his legends of the City of Mexico. The
giant has almost faded from fiction, since, poor thing, he
doesn&rsquo;t fit in well with the modern scheme of housing.
He came into the Gothic novel from the Oriental tale
where he had his origin, but now he appears in our fiction
only sporadically, as in Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <cite>The Selfish Giant</cite>,
in a couple of stories by Blackwood, and a few others.
We are glad to meet him occasionally in frank folk-tales
since literature at large repudiates this favorite of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
youth. He would not suit well on the stage, for obvious
reasons, and realism rejects him.</p>

<p>Lord Dunsany tells of elves and gnomes, of the Moomoo,
of the magic sword called Mouse, of the gnoles that caught
Tonker, of the ancient Thuls, of the window that opened
to the magic of the world, and of many other things which
only the very young or the very wise care for.</p>

<p>Arthur Machen deals with strange, sinister aspects of
supernaturalism unlike the wholesome folklore that other
writers reveal to us. He seems to take his material
chiefly from the Pit, to let loose upon the world a slimy
horde of unnamable spirits of ageless evil. One reads of
the White People, who are most loathsome fairies under
whose influence the rocks dance obscene dances in the
Witches&rsquo; Sabbath, and the great white moon seems an
unclean thing. Images of clay made by human hands come
to diabolic life, and at mystic incantations the nymph
Alanna turns the pool in the woodland to a pool of fire.
In <cite>The Great God Pan</cite> the timeless menace comes to earth
again, corrupting the souls of men and women, rendering
them unbelievably vile. In <cite>The Red Hand</cite> he brings
together ancient runes with magic power, black stones
that tell secrets of buried treasure, flinty stone like
obsidian ten thousand years old that murders a man on a
London street, a whorl of figures that tell of the black
heaven, giving an impression of vast ages of enigmatic
power. One feels one should rinse his mind out after
reading Arthur Machen&rsquo;s stories, particularly the collection
called <cite>The Three Impostors</cite>.</p>

<p>This discussion has taken more note of the Celtic
folk-fiction than of any other group influence, because
more than any other it has left its imprint on modern
literature. There are hundreds of volumes of folk-tales
of the supernatural in English, but the Celtic Revival has
molded its legends into literature that is its own excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
for being. In the work of this school we get a passionate
mysticism, a poetic symbolism that we find scarcely anywhere
else in English prose, save in such rhapsodic
passages as some of De Quincey&rsquo;s impassioned prose.
Melody, which forms so large a part of the effect of supernaturalism
in poetry, is here employed to heighten lyric
prose. Some of the wild stories are like the croon of the
peasant mother by her cradle beside the peat-fire, some
like wild barbaric runes of terrible unguessed import,
some like the battle-cry of hero-gods, some like the
keening of women beside their dead. The essential poetry
of the Celtic soul pours itself forth in rapturous, wistful
music, now like a chant, a hymn, a wedding-song, a
lament for the lost soul.</p>

<p>In the Celtic folk-tales we get a mixture of romances,
of the survivals of barbaric days, the ancient druid myths,
the pagan legends, savage beliefs overlaid and interwoven
with the later Christian traditions. Sometimes the old
pagan myths themselves become moral allegories, the
legend being used to tell a late-learned moral truth. But,
for the most part, there is no attempt at teaching save
that which comes spontaneously, the outburst of passionate,
poetic romance, the heritage of a people that love
wonder and beauty.</p>

<p>The pagan poetry of the Gaelic race lives on and throbs
over again in Fiona McLeod&rsquo;s symbolic moralities. The
mystical figures of awe and woe appear from the dim past,
a rapturous paganism showing through the medieval
religious brooding. Yet they are so symbolic of the spirit
that they are timeless. Coming as they do out of the dim
legendary past, they may reflect the veiled years of the
future. They are mystic chronicles of the soul, as in <cite>The
Divine Adventure</cite>, where the Body and Will alike shrink
back from that &ldquo;silent, sad-eyed foreigner, the Soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the stories of Yeats we get similar effects, the weird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
power of the old curse-making bards, the gift of second-sight,
a spiritual vision, the spiritual sense that hears
past the broken discordant sounds the music of the world,
the power to catch the moment &ldquo;that trembles with the
Song of Immortal Powers.&rdquo; We hear faint whispers,
catch fleeting glimpses of the Dim People, see again the
druids, the culdees, the ancient bards and heroes. We
discern in the Celtic literature a sadness, dim, unreasoning
yet deep, such as we see in the faces of animals and little
children. We see such symbolism as that of the self-centered
lovers who have heart-shaped mirrors instead of
hearts, seeing only their own images throughout eternity.
We feel the poetic thoughts drifting past us like sweet
falling rose-leaves, bright with the colors of bygone years,
like fluttering bird-wings, like happy sighs. Yet again
they are terrible trumpets blown in the day of doom.
We have the modern mysticism and symbolism side by
side with the old druidic mysticism, which seems like
dream-stuff with deep spiritual import. Yeats makes us
feel that the old divinities are not dead, but have taken
up their abode in the hearts of poets and writers of
romance, and that the land of faery is all about us if we
would only see. But we lack the poetic vision. He makes
us see the actuality of thought, that thinking has its own
vital being and goes out into the world like a living thing,
possessed by some wandering soul. He shows us that
thought can create black hounds or silver doves to follow
the soul, bring to life at will a divinity or a demon.</p>

<p>A certain supernatural element of style seems to lend
itself to some of the writers of strange fiction. Some of
Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s sentences unfold like wild, exotic flowers, in
a perfumed beauty that suggests a subtle poison at the
heart. Lord Dunsany writes joyously of fantastic creatures
with a happy grace, sometimes like a lilting laugh,
sometimes a lyric rhapsody. His evoked beings are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sportive or awesome but never unclean. Arthur Machen&rsquo;s
stories have an effect like a slimy trail of some loathly
beast or serpent. William Morris&rsquo;s style is like an old
Norse rune, while Algernon Blackwood makes us think
of awakened, elemental forces hostile to man. We feel
bodiless emotions, feelings unclothed with flesh, sad
formless spirits blown on the winds of the world. These
folk-tales reflect the sweet carelessness of the Irish soul,
the stern sadness of the Scotch, the psychic subtlety of the
modern English. And as the study of folk-lore has
influenced the fiction of the supernatural, so these published
romances have aroused a wondering interest in the
legendry of the past and made of folk-lore a science.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="stl">Supernatural Science</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> application of modern science to supernaturalism,
or of the supernatural to modern science, is one
of the distinctive features of recent literature.
Ghostly fiction took a new and definite turn with the rapid
advance in scientific knowledge and investigation in the
latter part of the nineteenth century, for the work of
Darwin, Spencer, Huxley, and their co-laborers did as
much to quicken thought in romance as in other lines.
Previous literature had made but scant effort to reflect
even the crude science of the times, and what was written
was so unconvincing that it made comparatively little
impress. Almost the only science that Gothic fiction
dealt with, to any noticeable extent, was associated with
alchemy and astrology. The alchemist sought the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone and the elixir of life while the astrologer
tried to divine human destiny by the stars. Zofloya
dabbled in diabolic chemistry, and Frankenstein created
a man-monster that was noteworthy as an incursion into
supernatural biology, yet they are almost isolated instances.
Now each advance in science has had its reflection
in supernatural fiction and each phase of research
contributes plot material, while some of the elements
once considered wholly of the devil are now scientific.
The sorcerer has given place to the bacteriologist and the
botanist, the marvels of discovery have displaced miracles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
as basis for unearthly plot material, and it is from the
laboratory that the ghostly stories are now evolved,
rather than from the vault and charnel-room as in the past.
Science not only furnishes extraordinary situations for
curdling tales, but it is an excellent hook to hang supernatural
tales upon, for it gives an excuse for believing
anything, however incredible. Man is willing to accept
the impossible, if he be but given a modern excuse for it.
He will swallow the wildest improbability if the bait be
labeled science or psychical research. No supernaturalism
is incredible if it is expressed in technical terminology,
and no miracle will be rejected if its setting be in a laboratory.
One peculiar thing about modern scientific thought
in its reaction upon fiction is that it is equally effective
in realism, such as shown in the naturalistic novels of
Zola, the plays of Brieux and others, and in supernaturalism,
as in the work of H.&nbsp;G. Wells, for instance, where the
ghostly is grafted on to cold realism.</p>

<p>The transition from the sorcerer, the wizard, the warlock
of older fiction to the scientist in the present has been
gradual. The sorcerer relied wholly upon supernatural,
chiefly diabolic, agencies for his power, while the wizard
of the modern laboratory applies his knowledge of molecules
and gases to aid his supermortal forces. Modern
science itself seems miraculous, so its employment in
ghostly stories is but natural. The <cite>Arabian Nights&rsquo; Tales</cite>
seem not more marvelous than the stories of modern
investigations. Hawthorne&rsquo;s narratives stand between the
old and the new types of science, his Rappaccini, Dr.
Heidigger, Gaffer Dolliver, Septimius Felton and his
rivals in search for the elixir of youth, as well as the
husband who sought to efface the birthmark from his
young wife&rsquo;s cheek, being related in theme to the older
conventional type and in treatment to the new. Poe&rsquo;s
scientific stories are more modern in method and material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and in fact he made claim of originality of invention for
the idea of making fiction plausible by the use of scientific
laws. His <cite>Descent into the Maelstrom</cite>, <cite>MS. Found in a
Bottle</cite>, and other stories were novel in the manner in which
they united the scientifically real and the supernatural.
<cite>The Pit and the Pendulum</cite>, with its diabolical machinery,
is akin to the modern mechanistic stories rather than to
anything that had preceded it. Poe paved the way for
H.&nbsp;G. Wells&rsquo;s use of the ghostly mechanical and scientific
narratives, as his stories of hypnotism with its hideous
aftermath of horror must have given suggestion for Arthur
Machen&rsquo;s revolting stories of physical operations with
unearthly consequences. An example of the later manifestations
of supernaturalism in connection with science
is in Sax Rohmer&rsquo;s tales of Fu-Manchu, the Chinese
terror, the embodied spirit of an ancient evil that entered
into him at his birth, because of his nearness to an old
burying-ground, and who, to his unholy alliance unites a
wizard knowledge of modern science in its various aspects.
With every power of cunning and intellect intensified,
with a technical knowledge of all means with which to
fight his enemies, he ravages society as no mere sorcerer
of early fiction could do.</p>

<p>The modern stories of magic have a skillful power of
suggestiveness, being so cunningly contrived that on the
surface they seem plausible and natural, with nothing
supernatural about them. Yet behind this seeming
simplicity lurks a mystery, an unanswered question, an
unsolved problem. W.&nbsp;W. Jacobs&rsquo;s <cite>The Monkey&rsquo;s Paw</cite>,
for instance, is one of the most effectively terrible stories
of magic that one could conceive of. The shriveled paw
of a dead monkey, that is believed by some to give its
possessor the right to have three wishes granted, becomes
the symbol of inescapable destiny, the Weird, or Fate of
the old tragedy, though the horrors that follow upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
wishes&rsquo; rash utterance <em>may</em> be explained on natural
grounds. The insidious enigma is what makes the story
unforgettable. Barry Pain&rsquo;s <cite>Exchange</cite> might be given as
another example of problematic magic that owes its power
to elusive mystery. The witch-woman, the solitary Fate,
who appears to persons offering them such dreadful
alternatives, might be conceived of as the figment of sick
brains, yet the reader knows that she is not.</p>

<p>Richard Middleton&rsquo;s <cite>The Coffin Merchant</cite> seems simple
enough on the surface, and the literal-minded could explain
the occurrence on normal grounds, yet the story
has a peculiar haunting supernaturalism. A coffin
merchant claims to be able to know who among passers-by
will die soon, and hands a man an advertisement for a
coffin, asserting that he will need it. The man later goes
to the shop to rebuke the merchant for his methods but
ends by signing a contract for his own funeral. On
leaving, he shakes hands with the dealer, after which he
unconsciously puts his hand to his lips, feeling a slight
sting. He dies that night,&mdash;of what? Of poison, of fear,
of supernatural suggestion, or in the natural course of
events? The series called <cite>The Strange Cases of Dr.
Stanchion</cite>, by Josephine Daskam Bacon, shows instances
occurring among the clientele of a famous brain specialist,
where the materialist might put aside the explanation of
the supernatural, only to be confronted by still greater
problems. The relation between insanity and ghostliness
in recent fiction is significant and forms the crux of many
a story since Poe. Mrs. Bacon&rsquo;s <cite>The Miracle</cite>, for instance,
has its setting in an insane asylum, but the uncanny
happenings almost convince us of the sanity of the
patients and the paranoia of the outsiders. We come to
agree with the specialist that every person is more or less
a paranoiac, and none more so than he who scoffs at the
supernatural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Another aspect of the transfer of magic in modern
fiction to a scientific basis is that of second sight or supernatural
vision. This motif still retains all its former effect
of the unearthly, perhaps gaining more, since the scientific
twist seems to give the idea that the ghostly power resides
in the atoms and molecules and gases and machines
themselves, rather than in the person who manipulates
them, which is more subtly haunting in its impression.
Second sight has been used as a means for producing
uncanny effects all along the line of fiction. Defoe even
used it in a number of his hoax pamphlets, as well as in
his <cite>History of Duncan Campbell</cite>, and folk-lore is full of
such stories, especially in the Highlands.</p>

<p>The modern use of supernatural vision is based apparently
on natural science, which makes the weird power
more striking. <cite>The Black Patch</cite>, by Randolph Hartley,
tells of an experiment in optics that produces a strange
result. Two students exchange left eyeballs for the purpose
of studying the effects of the operation, leaving the
right eye in each case unimpaired. When the young men
recover from the operation and the bandages are removed,
they discover that an extraordinary thing has taken place.
The first, while seeing with his right eye his own surroundings
as usual, sees also with his left&mdash;which is his friend&rsquo;s
left, that is&mdash;what that friend is looking at with his right
eye, thousands of miles away. The severing of the optic
nerve has not disturbed the sympathetic vision between
the companion eyes, so this curious double sight results.
In a quarrel arising from this peculiar situation, the
first man kills the second, and sees on his left eye the
hideous image of his own face distorted with murderous
rage, as his friend saw it, which is never to be effaced,
because the companion eye is dead and will see no more.</p>

<p>Another instance of farsightedness is told in John
Kendrick Bangs&rsquo;s <cite>The Speck on the Lens</cite>, where a man has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
such an extraordinary left eye that when he looks through
a lens he sees round the world, and gets a glimpse of the
back of his own head which he thinks is a speck on the
lens. Only two men in the world are supposed to have
that power.</p>

<p><cite>The Remarkable Case of Davidson&rsquo;s Eyes</cite>, by H.&nbsp;G. Wells,
is an interesting example of this new scientific transference
of magic vision. Davidson is working in a laboratory
which is struck by lightning, and after the shock he finds
himself unable to visualize his surroundings, but instead
sees the other side of the world, ships, a sea, sands. The
explanation given by a professor turns on learned theories
of space and the Fourth Dimension. He thinks that
Davidson, in stooping between the poles of the electro-magnet,
experienced a queer twist in his mental retinal
elements through the sudden force of the lightning. As
the author says: &ldquo;It sets one dreaming of the oddest
possibilities of intercommunication in the future, of
spending an intercalary five minutes on the other side of
the world, of being watched in our most secret operations
by unexpected eyes.&rdquo; Davidson&rsquo;s vision comes back
queerly, for he begins to see the things around him by
piecemeal, as apparently the two fields of vision overlap
for a time.</p>

<p>Brander Matthews in <cite>The Kinetoscope of Time</cite> introduces
an instrument with eyepieces that show magic
vision. The beholder sees scenes from the past, from
literature as well as from life, has glimpses of Salome
dancing, of Esmerelda, witnesses the combat between
Achilles and Hector, the tourney between Saladin and
the Knight of the Leopard. The magician offers to show
him his future&mdash;for a price&mdash;but he is wise enough to
refuse.</p>

<p>Magic views of the future constitute an interesting
aspect of the supernatural vision in modern stories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
<cite>The Lifted Veil</cite>, by George Eliot, is an account of a man
who has prophetic glimpses of his fate, which seem powerless
to warn him, since he marries the woman who he
knows will be his doom, and he is aware that he will die
alone, deserted even by his servants, yet cannot help it.
He sees himself dying, with the attendants off on their
own concerns, knows every detail beforehand, but unavailingly.
This suggests <cite>Amos Judd</cite>, by J.&nbsp;A. Mitchell,
which is a curious instance of the transition stage of
second sight, related both to the old sorcerer type and to
the new scientific ideas. Amos Judd, so called, is the son
of an Indian rajah, sent out of his country because of a
revolution, and brought up in ignorance of his birth in a
New England farmhouse. Vishnu, in the far past, has
laid his finger on the brow of one of the rajah&rsquo;s ancestors,
thereby endowing him with the gift of magic vision, which
descends once in a hundred years to some one of his line.
Amos Judd therefore, can see the future by pictures,
beholding clearly everything that will happen to him.
He sees himself lying dead at a desk, on which stands a
calendar marking the date, November 4th. His friends
persuade him to live past the date, and they think all is
well, till one day while he is on a visit to a strange house
he is killed by an assassin. They find him lying at a desk,
with an out-of-date calendar beside him, marking November
4th.</p>

<p>Barry Pain endows a bulldog with the power to foretell
the future, to reveal disaster and oppose it. Zero, in the
story by that name, is a common bulldog greatly valued
because he has a supernatural knowledge of any evil that
threatens those he loves, and by his canine sagacity he
forestalls fate. In the end, in protecting his master&rsquo;s little
child, he is bitten by a mad dog, whose coming he has
supernaturally foreseen, and he commits suicide as the
only way out of the difficulty. Arthur Machen, in <cite>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Bowmen and Others</cite>, tells varied stories of supernatural
vision associated with the war.</p>

<p><cite>The Door in the Wall</cite>, by H.&nbsp;G. Wells, depicts a man who in
his dreamy childhood wanders into a secret garden where
he is shown the book of his past and future, but who
afterwards is unable to find the door by which he enters,
though he seeks it often. Later in life, at several times
when he is in a special haste to reach some place for an
important appointment, he sees the door, but does not
enter. Finally he goes in to his death. This is an instance
of the suggestive supernaturalism associated with dreams
and visions.</p>

<p>The use of mirrors in supernatural vision is significant
and appears in a number of ways in modern fiction.
Scott&rsquo;s <cite>My Aunt Margaret&rsquo;s Mirror</cite> is an early instance,
where the magician shows the seeker a glass wherein she
sees what is taking place in another country, sees her
husband on his way to the altar with another woman, sees
a stranger stop the marriage, and witnesses the fatal duel.
Hawthorne has used mirrors extensively as symbolic of
an inner vision, of a look into the realities of the soul. For
instance, when poor Feathertop, the make-believe man,
the animated scarecrow, looks into the mirror he sees
not the brave figure the world beholds in him, but the
thing of sticks and straw, the sham that he is, as the
minister shrinks from the mirrored reflection of the black
veil, symbol of mystery that he wears. Hawthorne elsewhere
speaks of Echo as the voice of the reflection in a
mirror, and says that our reflections are ghosts of ourselves.
Mr. Titbottom, in George William Curtis&rsquo;s <cite>Prue
and I</cite>, who has the power of seeing into the souls of human
beings by means of his magic spectacles and catching
symbolic glimpses of what they are instead of what they
appear to be, beholds himself in a mirror and shrinks back
aghast from the revelation of his own nature. Barry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Pain&rsquo;s story, referred to in another connection, shows a
mirror wherein a supernatural visitant reveals to a young
man the supreme moments of life, his own and those of
others, pictures of the highest moments of ecstasy or
despair, of fulfillment of dear dreams.</p>

<p><cite>The Silver Mirror</cite>, by A. Conan Doyle, represents a
man alone night after night, working with overstrained
nerves on a set of books, who sees in an antique mirror a
strange scene re-enacted and finds later that the glass has
once belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots, and that he has
seen the murder of Rizzio. Brander Matthews also has
a story concerned with re-created images in an old mirror.
The looking-glass in fiction seems to be not only a sort of
hand conscience, as Markheim calls it, but a betrayer of
secrets, a revealer of the forgotten past, a prophet of the
future as well. It is also a strange symbol to show hearts
as they are in reality, reflecting the soul rather than the
body. It is employed in diverse ways and is an effective
means of supernatural suggestion, of ghostly power.</p>

<p>The Fourth Dimension is another motif that seems to
interest the writers of recent ghostly tales. They make
use of it in various ways and seem to have different ideas
concerning it, but they like to play with the thought and
twist it to their whim. Ambrose Bierce has a collection
of stories dealing with mysterious disappearances, in
which he tells of persons who are transferred from the
known, calculable space to some &ldquo;non-Euclidean space&rdquo;
where they are lost. In some strange pockets of nowhere
they fall, unable to see or to be seen, to hear or to be
heard, neither living nor dying, since &ldquo;in that space is
no power of life or of death.&rdquo; It is all very mysterious
and uncanny. He uses the theme as the basis for a
number of short stories of ghostly power, which offer no
solution but leave the mystery in the air. In some of
these stories Bierce represents the person as crying out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and being heard, but no help can go, because he is invisible
and intangible, not knowing where he is nor what
has happened to him. H.&nbsp;G. Wells, in <cite>The Plattner Case</cite>,
which shows an obvious influence of Bierce, gives a similar
case. He explains the extraordinary happenings by
advancing the theory that Plattner has changed sides.
According to mathematics, he says, we are told that the
only way in which the right and left sides of a solid body
can be changed is by taking that body clean out of space
as we know it, out of ordinary existence, that is, and
turning it somewhere outside space. Plattner has been
moved out into the Fourth Dimension and been returned
to the world with a curious inversion of body. He is
absent from the world for nine days and has extraordinary
experiences in the Other-World. This happens through
an explosion in the laboratory where he is working, similarly
to Wells&rsquo;s story of Davidson, where the infringement
on the Fourth Dimension is the result of a lightning stroke.</p>

<p>Mary Wilkins Freeman deals with the Fourth Dimension
in <cite>The Hall Bedroom</cite>, where the boarder drifts off
into unknown space, never to return, from gazing at a
picture on the wall, as has happened in the case of previous
occupants of the room. Richard Middleton employs
the same idea in a story of a conjurer who nightly plays a
trick in public, causing his wife to seem to disappear into
space. One night she actually does so vanish, never to be
seen again. Other instances of the form may be found
in recent fiction. H.&nbsp;G. Wells uses the theme with a different
twist in his <cite>Time Machine</cite>. Here the scientist
insists that time is the Fourth Dimension, that persons
who talk of the matter ordinarily have no idea of what it is,
but that he has solved it. He constructs a machine which
enables him to project himself into the future or into the
past, and sees what will happen or what has happened
in other centuries. He lives years in the space of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
moments and has amazing adventures on his temporal
expeditions. But finally the Fourth Dimension, which
may be thought of as a terrible Fate or inescapable destiny
awaiting all who dally with it, gets him too, for he fails
to return from one of his trips. Another story tells of a
man who by drinking quantities of green tea could
project himself into the Fourth Dimension.</p>

<p>A number of stories of scientific supernaturalism are
concerned with glimpses into the future. <cite>The Time
Machine</cite>, just mentioned, with its invasions of the unknown
space and time, its trips into eternity by the
agency of a miraculous vehicle, illustrates the method.
The scientist finds that he can travel backwards or forwards,
accelerating or retarding his speed as he will, and
get a section of life in any age he wishes. He discovers
that in the future which he visits many reforms have been
inaugurated, preventive medicine established, noxious
weeds eradicated, and yet strange conditions exist.
Mankind has undergone a two-fold involution, the soft
conditions of life having caused the higher classes to
degenerate into flabby beings of no strength, while an
underground race has grown up of horrible depraved
nature, blind from living in subterranean passages, cannibalistic
while the others are vegetarian. The lower classes
are like hideous apes, while the higher are effeminate,
relaxed. The traveler escapes a dire fate only by rushing
to his machine and returning to his own time. Samuel
Butler suggests that machines will be the real rulers in the
coming ages, that man will be preserved only to feed and
care for the machines which will have attained supernatural
sensibility and power. He says that mechanisms
will acquire feelings and tastes and culture, and that man
will be the servant of steel and steam in the future, instead
of master as now; that engines will wed and rear families
which men, as slaves, must wait upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank R. Stockton<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> gives another supernatural scientific
glimpse into the future, showing as impossibilities
certain things that have since come to pass, while some
of the changes prophesied as imminent are yet unrealized
and apparently far from actualities. Jack London&rsquo;s
<cite>Scarlet Plague</cite> pictures the earth returned to barbarism,
since most of the inhabitants have been swept away by
a scourge and the others have failed to carry on the torch
of civilization. H.&nbsp;G. Wells<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> gives account of a tour into
futurity, wherein the miracles of modern science work
revolutions in human life, and<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> he satirizes society,
showing a topsy-turvy state of affairs in <span class="f8">A.D.</span> 2100. His
<cite>Dream of Armageddon</cite> is a story of futurity wherein a man
has continuous visions of what his experiences will be in
another life far in the future. That life becomes more
real to him than his actual existence, and he grows indifferent
to events taking place around him while rent
with emotion over the griefs to come in another age.
Of course, Edward Bellamy&rsquo;s <cite>Looking Backward</cite>, with its
social and mechanistic miracles that now seem flat and
tame to us, might be said to be the father of most of
these modern prophecies of scientific futurity. Samuel
Butler&rsquo;s <cite>Erewhon</cite> contains many elements of impossibility
in relation to life, and is a satire on society, though perhaps
not, strictly speaking, supernatural. These prophecies
of the time to come are in the main intended as social
satires, as symbolic analyses of the weaknesses of
present life. They evince vivid imagination and much
ingenuity in contriving the mechanisms that are to
transform life, yet they are not examples of great fiction.
Mark Twain reverses the type in his <cite>Connecticut Yankee
at King Arthur&rsquo;s Court</cite>, for he shows a man of the present
taking part in the life of the far past, managing to parody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
both mediævalism and the Yankee character at once.
H.&nbsp;G. Wells is particularly interested in studying the
unused forces of the world and fancying what would
happen under other conditions. His play of scientific
speculation has produced many stories that he does not
greatly value now himself, but which are of interest as
showing certain tendencies of fiction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Views of other planets form a feature of modern supernaturalism,
for the writer now sets his stories not only on
earth, in heaven, and in hell but on other worlds besides.
The astrologer of ancient fiction, with his eye fixed ever
on the stars, seeking to discern their influence on human
destiny, appears no more among us. He has been replaced
by the astronomer who scans the stars yet with a
different purpose in fiction. He wishes to find out the
life of citizens of other planets rather than to figure out
the fate of mortals on the earth. Many stories of modern
times cause new planets to swim into our literary ken and
describe their citizens with ease. H.&nbsp;G. Wells stars here as
elsewhere. In his <cite>War of the Worlds</cite> he depicts a struggle
between the earth people and the Martians, in which
many supernatural elements enter. The people of Mars
are a repulsive horde of creatures, yet they have wonderful
organization and command of resources, and they conquer
the earth to prey upon it. This book has suffered the
inevitable parody.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> In <cite>The Crystal Egg</cite>, Wells describes
a curious globe in which the gazer can see scenes reflected
from Mars. The author suggests two theories as to the
possibility of this,&mdash;either that the crystal is in both
worlds at once, remaining stationary in one and moving
in the other, and that it reflects scenes in Mars so that
they are visible on earth, or else that by a peculiar sympathy
with a companion globe on the other planet it shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
on its surface what happens in the other world. It is
hinted that the Martians have sent the crystal to the earth
in order that they might catch glimpses of our life.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Star</cite>, Wells gives yet another story of the future,
of other planetary influences. By the passing of a strange
star, life on earth is convulsed and conditions radically
changed. These conditions are observed by the astronomers
on Mars, who are beings different from men, yet
very intelligent. They draw conclusions as to the amount
of damage done to the earth, satirizing human theories
as to Mars. <cite>The Days of the Comet</cite> shows earthly life
changed by the passing of a comet, but instead of the
destruction described in the other story, the social conditions
are vastly improved and a millennium is ushered in.
Wells<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> makes a voyage to the moon possible by the discovery
of a substance which resists gravity. Other instances
might be given, for there has been no lack of
lunar literature, but they are not usually worth much.</p>

<p>Du Maurier&rsquo;s <cite>The Martian</cite>, which combines the elements
of metempsychosis, automatic writing, and dream-supernaturalism,
with the idea of ghostly astronomy,
tells of a supernatural visitant from Mars. The Martian
is a young woman whose spirit comes to inhabit a
young man to whom she dictates wonderful books in his
dreams. She writes letters to him in a sort of private
code, in which she tells of her previous incarnations on
Mars, of the Martians who are extraordinary amphibious
beings, descended from a small sea animal. They have
unusual acuteness of senses with an added sixth sense, a
sort of orientation, a feeling of a magnetic current, which
she imparts to her protégé, Barty Joscelyn. Jack
London<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> tells a story of interplanetary metempsychosis,
where the central character, a prisoner in San Quentin,
finds himself able to will his body to die at times, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
releasing his spirit to fly through space and relive its
experiences in previous incarnations.</p>

<p>Barry Pain&rsquo;s <cite>The Celestial Grocery</cite> is a phantasy of
insanity and the supernatural, with its setting on two
planets. It contains a cab horse that talks and laughs,
and other inversions of the natural. A man is taken on a
journey to another world, sees the stars and the earth in
space beneath him, and finds everything different from
what he has known before. People there have two bodies
and send them alternately to the wash, though they
seldom wear them. The celestial shop sells nothing
concrete, only abstractions, emotions, experiences. One
may buy measures of love, requited or unselfishly hopeless,
of political success, of literary fame, or of power or what-not.
Happiness is a blend, however, for which one must
mix the ingredients for himself. The story is symbolic
of the ideals of earth, with a sad, effective satire. The
end is insanity, leaving one wondering how much of it is
pure phantasy of a mad man&rsquo;s brain or how much actuality.
It is reminiscent of Hawthorne&rsquo;s Intelligence Office
with its symbolic supernaturalism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hypnotism enters largely into the fiction of modern
times. Hypnotism may or may not be considered as
supernatural, yet it borders so closely on to the realm
of the uncanny, and is so related to science of to-day as
well as to the sorcery of the past, that it should be considered
in this connection for it carries on the traditions
of the supernatural. In its earlier stages hypnotism was
considered as distinctly diabolic, used only for unlawful
purposes, being associated with witchcraft. It is only in
more recent times that it has been rehabilitated in the
public mind and thought of as a science which may be
used for helpful ends. It is so mysterious in its power that
it affords complications in plenty for the novelist and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
been utilized in various ways. In some cases, as F.
Marion Crawford&rsquo;s <cite>The Witch of Prague</cite>, it is associated
still with evil power and held as a black art. Unorna has
an unearthly power gained through hypnotism which is
more than hypnotic, and which she uses to further her
own ends. Strange scientific ideas of life and of death
are seen here, and someone says of her: &ldquo;You would make a
living mummy of a man. I should expect to find him
with his head cut off and living by means of a glass heart
and thinking through a rabbit&rsquo;s brain.&rdquo; She embalms an
old man in a continuous hypnotic lethargy, recalling him
only at intervals to do mechanically the things necessary
to prolong life. She is trying to see if she can cause human
tissue to live forever in this embalmed state, hoping to
learn through it the secret of eternal life. This, of course,
suggests Poe&rsquo;s stories of the subject, <cite>Mesmeric Revelations</cite>
and <cite>The Facts in the Case of M. Waldemar</cite>. The latter is one
of the most revolting instances of scientific supernaturalism,
for the dying man is mesmerized in the moment of
death and remains in that condition, dead, yet undecaying,
and speaking, repeating with his horrible tongue the statement,
&ldquo;I am dead.&rdquo; After seven months, further experiments
break the spell, and he, pleading to be allowed to be
at peace in death, falls suddenly away into a loathsome,
liquid putrescence before the eyes of the experimenters.</p>

<p><cite>The Portent</cite>, by George MacDonald, is a curious study of
hypnotic influence, of a woman who is her true self only
when in a somnambulistic state. A supernatural connection
of soul exists between her and a youth born on the
same day, and it is only through his hypnotic aid that she
gains her personality and sanity. James L. Ford plays
with the subject by having a group of persons in an evening
party submit themselves to be hypnotized in turn, each
telling a true story of his life while in that condition.
W.&nbsp;D. Howells combines mesmerism with spiritualism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
in his novel,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> where the séances are really the result of
hypnotism rather than supernatural revelation as the
medium thinks. H.&nbsp;G. Wells has used this theme, as
almost every other form of scientific ghostliness, though
without marked success. The prize story of hypnotism,
however, still remains Du Maurier&rsquo;s <cite>Trilby</cite>, for no mesmerist
in this fiction has been able to outdo Svengali.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Uncanny chemistry forms the ingredient for many a
modern story. The alchemist was the favored feature of
the older supernatural fiction of science, and his efforts
to discover the philosopher&rsquo;s stone and to brew the magic
elixir have furnished plots for divers stories. He does not
often waste his time in these vain endeavors in recent
stories, though his efforts have not altogether ceased, as
we have seen in a previous chapter. A. Conan Doyle<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> is
among the last to treat the theme, and makes the scientist
find his efforts worse than useless, for the research student
finds that his discovery of the art of making gold is disturbing
the nice balance of nature and bringing injury to
those he meant to help, so he destroys his secret formula
and dies. <cite>The Elixir of Youth</cite> illustrates the transference
of power from the sorcerer to the scientist, for the magician
that gives the stranger a potion to restore his youth tells
him that he is not a sorcerer, not a diabolic agent, but a
scientist learning to utilize the forces that are at the
command of any intelligence.</p>

<p>Barry Pain&rsquo;s <cite>The Love Philter</cite> is related both to the old
and the new types of supernatural chemistry. A man
loves a woman who doesn&rsquo;t care, so he asks aid of a wise
woman, who gives him a potion that will surely win the
stubborn heart. As he lies asleep in the desert, on his way
back, he dreams that his love says to him that love gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
by such means is not love, so he pours the liquid on the
sand. When he returns, the woman tells him that she has
been with him in his dreams and loves him because he
would not claim her wrongly. <cite>Blue Roses</cite> is another of his
stories of magic that bring love to the indifferent. <cite>Twilight</cite>,
by Frank Danby, is a novel based on the relation between
morphia and the supernatural. A woman ill of nervous
trouble, under the influence of opiates, continually sees the
spirit of a woman dead for years, who relives her story
before her eyes, so that the personalities are curiously
merged. This inevitably suggests De Quincey&rsquo;s <cite>Confessions
of an English Opium-Eater</cite> with its dream-wonders,
yet it has a power of its own and the skillful
blending of reality with dream-supernaturalism and
insanity has an uncanny distinction.</p>

<p>Fu-Manchu, the Chinese wonder-worker in Sax Rohmer&rsquo;s
series of stories bearing that name, is a representative
example of the modern use of chemistry for
supernormal effect. He employs all the forces of up-to-the-minute
science to compass his diabolic ends and
works miracles of chemistry by seemingly natural methods.
By a hypodermic injection he can instantly drive a man
to acute insanity incurable save by a counter-injection
which only Fu-Manchu can give, but which as instantly
restores the reason. By another needle he can cause a
person to die&mdash;to all intents and purposes, at least,&mdash;and
after the body has been buried for days he can restore
it to life by another prick of the needle. He terrorizes
England by his infernal powers, killing off or converting
to slavery the leading intelligences that oppose him.</p>

<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s <cite>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</cite> is perhaps the
best-known instance of chemical supernaturalism. Here
the magic drug not only changes the body, evolving from
the respectable Dr. Jekyll his baser self in the form of Mr.
Hyde, enabling him to give rein to his criminal instincts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
without bringing reproach on his reputation, but has the
subtle power to fix the personality of evil, so that each
time the drug is used Hyde is given a stronger force and
Jekyll is weakened. This fictive sermon on dual nature,
the ascendence of evil over the nobler soul if it be indulged,
seems yet an appallingly real story of human life. In a
similar fashion Arthur Machen uses supernatural chemistry
most hideously in <cite>The Three Impostors</cite>, where a certain
powder perverts the soul, making man a sharer in the
unspeakable orgies of ancient evil forces.</p>

<p><cite>The Invisible Man</cite>, by H.&nbsp;G. Wells, shows an unusual
application of chemistry to ghostly fiction that gives a
peculiar effect of reality because its style is that of scientific
realism. By experimentation with drugs a man finds
a combination that will render living tissue absolutely
invisible. When he swallows a portion of it, he cannot
be seen. His clothes appear to be walking around by
themselves and the complications are uncanny. As one
may see, the comic possibilities are prominent and for a
time we laugh over the mystification of the persons with
whom he comes in contact, but soon stark tragedy results.
During the man-chase, as the hunted creature seeks to
escape, the people hear the thud-thud of running steps,
watch bloody footprints form before their eyes, yet see
nothing else. Here is a genuine thrill that is new in fiction.
The man gradually becomes visible, but only in death is
his dreadful figure seen completely again. This modern
method of transferring to science the idea of invisibility
so prominent in connection with ghosts, showing the
invisibility as the result of a chemical compound, not of
supernatural intervention, affecting a living man not a
spirit, makes the effect of supernaturalism more vivid
even than in the case of ghosts.</p>

<p>These are only suggestions of the varied uses to which
chemistry has been put in producing ghostly plots and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
utilizing in novel ways the conventional motifs of older
stories. These themes are more popular now than they
would have been half a century ago because now the
average reader knows more about scientific facts and is
better prepared to appreciate them. A man ignorant of
chemistry would care nothing for the throes of Dr. Jekyll
or the complicating experiences of the invisible man,
because he would have slight basis for his imagination to
build upon. Each widening of the popular intelligence
and each branch of science added to the mental store of
the ordinary reader is a distinct gain to fiction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Supernatural biology looms large in modern fiction,
though it is not always easy to differentiate between the
predominance of chemical and biological motifs. In
many cases the two are tangled up together, and as, in the
stories of dual personality and invisibility just mentioned,
one may not readily say which is uppermost, the biological
or the chemical side, for the experiments are of the effects
of certain drugs upon living human tissue. There are
various similar instances in the fiction of scientific supernaturalism.
Hawthorne&rsquo;s <cite>The Birthmark</cite> is a case of
chemical biology, where the husband seeking to remove
by powerful drugs the mark from his wife&rsquo;s cheek succeeds
in doing so but causes her death. Here the supernaturalism
is symbolic, suggested rather than boldly stated, as is
usually the case with Hawthorne&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>A. Conan Doyle in <cite>The Los Amigos Fiasco</cite> shows supernaturalism
based on the effect of electricity on the body,
for the lynchers in trying to kill a man by connecting him
with a dynamo succeed in so magnetizing him that he
can&rsquo;t be killed in any way. Sax Rohmer tells one Fu-Manchu
story of a mysterious murder committed by
means of an imprisoned gas that escapes from a mummy
case and poisons those exposed to it, and, in another, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
introduces a diabolic red insect attracted by the scent of
a poisonous orchid, that bites the marked victim.</p>

<p>Wells&rsquo;s <cite>The Island of Dr. Moreau</cite> is a ghastly study in
vivisection. Two scientists on a remote island with no
other human inhabitants try unspeakable experiments on
animals, trying by pruning and grafting and training the
living tissue to make them human. They do succeed in a
measure, for they teach the beasts to talk and to observe
a sort of jungle law laid down by man, yet the effect is
sickening. The animals are not human and never can be,
and these revolting experiments deprive them of all
animal dignity without adding any of the human. In the
end they revert to savagery, becoming even more bestial
than before. The most dreadful biological experiments
in recent fiction are described in Arthur Machen&rsquo;s volume
of short stories, <cite>The House of Souls</cite>. In one story an
operation on the brain enables a victim to &ldquo;see the great
god Pan,&rdquo; to have revelations of ancient supernaturalism
wherein Pan and the devil are united in one character.
In another, a delicate cutting of the brain removes the
soul,&mdash;which takes the form of a wonderful jewel,&mdash;and
utterly diabolizes the character. These curious and
revolting stories are advanced instances of scientific
diabolism and leave a smear on the mind. They are more
horrible than the creation of Frankenstein&rsquo;s man-monster,
for here moral monsters are evolved.</p>

<p>Medicated supernaturalism associated with prenatal
influence occurs in various stories where a supernormal
twist is given because of some event out of the ordinary.
Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s <cite>The Eyes of the Panther</cite>, a story of a
young woman who is a panther for part of the time as a
result of a shock, is associated with the snake nature of
Elsie Venner. Barry Pain&rsquo;s <cite>The Undying Thing</cite> is one of
the most horrible of such complications, for because of a
mother&rsquo;s fright over a pack of wolves a monster is born,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
neither wolf nor human, neither animal nor man, neither
mortal nor immortal. It is hidden in a secret cave to die,
yet lives on, though not living, to fulfil a curse upon the
ancient house. A. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s <cite>The Terror of Blue
John Gap</cite> is a story of a monstrous animal, like a bear yet
bigger than an elephant, that ravages the countryside.
The theory for its being is that it is a survival, in a subterranean
cave, of a long-extinct type, from prehistoric
times, that comes out in its blindness to destroy. There
are other examples of supernormal animals in modern
fiction, yet these suffice to illustrate the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Botany furnishes its ghostly plots in fiction as well as
other branches of science, for we have plant vampires and
witches and devils. Trees and flowers are highly psychic
and run a gamut of emotions. Hawthorne shows us
supernatural plants in several of his novels and stories,
such as the mysterious plant growing from a secret grave,
which has a strange poisonous power, or the flowers from
Gaffer Dolliver&rsquo;s garden that shine like jewels and lend a
glow to the living face near them, when worn on a woman&rsquo;s
breast. In <cite>Rappaccini&rsquo;s Daughter</cite> the garden is full of
flowers of subtle poison, so insidious that their venom has
entered into the life of the young girl, rendering her a living
menace to those around her. She is the victim of her
father&rsquo;s dæmonic experiments in the effects of poison on the
human body, and her kiss means death. Algernon Blackwood<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
tells of the uncanny power of motion and emotion
possessed by the trees, where the forest exercises a magnetic
force upon human beings sympathetic to them, going
out after men and luring them to their fate. He describes
the cedar as friendly to man and attempting but in vain to
protect him from the creeping malignant power of the forest.</p>

<p>Fu-Manchu, Sax Rohmer&rsquo;s Chinese horror, performs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
various experiments in botany to further his dreadful ends.
He develops a species of poisonous fungi till they become
giant in size and acquire certain powers through being
kept in the darkness. When a light is turned on them, the
fungi explode, turning loose, on the men he would murder,
fumes that drive them mad. From the ceiling above are
released ripe spores of the giant Empusa, for the air in the
second cellar, being surcharged with oxygen, makes them
germinate instantly. They fall like powdered snow upon
the victims and the horrible fungi grow magically, spreading
over the writhing bodies of the mad-men and wrapping
them in ghostly shrouds. In <cite>The Flower of Silence</cite> he
describes a strange orchid that has the uncanny habit of
stinging or biting when it is broken or roughly handled,
sending forth a poison that first makes a man deaf then
kills him. Fu-Manchu introduces this flower into the
sleeping-rooms of those he wishes to put out of the way,
and sends them into eternal silence. <cite>The Flowering of the
Strange Orchid</cite>, by H.&nbsp;G. Wells, is the story of a murderous
plant, a vampire that kills men in the jungle, and in a
greenhouse in England sends out its tentacles that grip
the botanist, drinking his blood and seeking to slay him.
This orchid has the power to project its vampiric attacks
when it is a shriveled bulb or in the flower. This reminds
us of Algernon Blackwood&rsquo;s story of the vampire soil,
which after its psychic orgy burst into loathsome
luxuriant bloom where before it had been barren.</p>

<p>It is a curious heightening of supernatural effect to
give to beautiful flowers diabolical cunning and murderous
motives, to endow them with human psychology and
devilish designs. The magic associated with botany is
usually black instead of white. One wonders if transmigration
of soul does not enter subconsciously into these
plots, and if a vampire orchid is not a trailing off of a
human soul, the murderous blossom a revenge ghost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
expressing himself in that way. The plots in this type of
fiction are wrought with much imagination and the
scientific exactness combined with the supernatural gives
a peculiar effect of reality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are varied forms of supernatural science that do
not come under any of the heads discussed. The applications
of research to weird fiction are as diverse as the
phases of investigation and only a few may be mentioned
to suggest the variety of themes employed. Inversion of
natural laws furnishes plots,&mdash;as in Frank R. Stockton&rsquo;s
<cite>Tale of Negative Gravity</cite> with its discovery of a substance
that enables a man to save himself all fatigue by means of
a something that inverts the law of gravity. With a little
package in his pocket a man can climb mountains without
effort, but the discoverer miscalculates the amount of
energy required to move and finally rises instead of staying
on the earth, till his wife has to fish him into the second-story
window. Poe&rsquo;s <cite>Loss of Breath</cite> illustrates another
infringement of a natural law, as do several stories where
a human being loses his shadow.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Diamond Lens</cite>, Fitz-James O&rsquo;Brien tells of a
man who looking at a drop of water through a giant
microscope sees in the drop a lovely woman with whom he
falls madly in love, only to watch her fade away under the
lens as his despairing eyes see the water evaporate.
Supernatural acoustics enters<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> in the story of a man who
discovers the sound-center in an opera house and reads
the unspoken thoughts of those around him. He applies
the laws of acoustics to mentality and spirituality,
making astounding discoveries. Bram Stoker combines
superstition with modern science in his books, as<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> where
Oriental magic is used to fight the encroachments of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
evil force emanating from a mummy, as also to bring the
mummy to life, while a respirator is employed to keep
away the subtle odor. He brings in blood transfusion
together with superstitious symbols, to combat the
ravages of vampires.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Blood transfusion also enters into
supernaturalism in Stephen French Whitney&rsquo;s story,
where a woman who has been buried in a glacier for two
thousand years is recalled to life.</p>

<p><cite>The Human Chord</cite>, by Algernon Blackwood, is a novel
based on the psychic values of sounds, which claims that
sounds are all powerful, are everything,&mdash;for forms, shapes,
bodies are but vibratory activities of sound made visible.
The research worker here believes that he who has the
power to call a thing by its proper name is master of that
thing, or of that person, and that to be able to call the
name of Deity would be to enable one to become as God.
He seeks to bring together a human chord, four persons
in harmony as to voice and soul, who can pronounce the
awful name and become divine with him. He can change
the form or the nature of anything by calling its name, as a
woman is deformed by mispronunciation, and the walls
of a room expanded by his voice. He can make of himself
a dwarf or a giant at will, by different methods of speaking
his own name. He says that sound could re-create or
destroy the universe. He has captured sounds that strain
at their leashes in his secret rooms, gigantic, wonderful.
But in the effort to call upon the mighty Name he mispronounces
it, bringing a terrible convulsion of nature
which destroys him. The beholders see an awful fire in
which Letters escape back to heaven in chariots of flame.</p>

<p>Psychology furnishes some interesting contributions
to recent fiction along the line of what might be called
momentary or instantaneous plots. Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s
<cite>The Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</cite> is a good example,&mdash;where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a man is being hanged and in the instant between
the drop from the bridge and the breaking of the neck he
lives through long and dramatic adventures, escaping
his pursuers by falling into the river and swimming ashore,
reaching home at last to greet his wife and children.
Yet in a second his lifeless body swings from the bridge.
<cite>The Warning</cite>, by Josephine Daskam Bacon, shows the
case of a man who lives years in another country during a
few moments of acute mental strain carried to the point of
paranoia. Barry Pain has a story where in the time in
which a man drives home from the theater he visits another
planet and changes the current of his life, while Algernon
Blackwood compresses a great experience into a few
minutes of dreaming.</p>

<p>One noteworthy point in connection with the scientific
supernaturalism is that these themes appear only in
novels and short stories. They do not cross over into
poetry as do most of the other forms of the ghostly art.
Perhaps this is because the situations are intellectual
rather than emotional, brain-problems or studies in
mechanisms rather than in feelings or emotions. The
province of science is removed from that of poetry because
the methods and purposes are altogether different. The
scientific methods are clear-cut, coldly intellectual.
Science demands an exactness, a meticulous accuracy
hostile to poetry which requires suggestion, vagueness,
veiled mystery for its greatest effect. <cite>The Flower of
Silence</cite>, for instance, would be a fitting title for a poem,
but the poetic effect would be destroyed by the need for
stating the genus and species of the orchid and analyzing
its destruction of human tissue. Nature&rsquo;s mysterious
forces and elements in general and vaguely considered,
veiled in mists of imagination and with a sense of vastness
and beauty, are extremely poetic. But the notebook and
laboratory methods of pure science are antagonistic to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
poetry, though they fit admirably into the requirements of
fiction, whose purpose is to give an impression of actuality.</p>

<p>Another reason why these scientific themes do not pass
over into poetry may be that scientific methods as we
know them are new, and poetry clings to the old and
established conventions and emotions. There is amazing
human interest in these experiments, a veritable wealth
of romance, with dramatic possibilities tragic and comic,
yet they are more suited to prose fiction than to poetry.
We have adapted our brain-cells to their concepts in prose,
yet we have not thus molded our poetic ideas. It gives
us a shock to have new concepts introduced into poetry.
An instance of this clash of realism with sentiment is
shown in a recent poem where the setting is a physics
laboratory. Yet in a few more decades we may find the
poets eagerly converting the raw materials of science into
the essence of poetry itself, and by a mystic alchemy more
wonderful than any yet known, transmuting intellectual
problems of science into magic verse. <cite>Creation</cite>, by Alfred
Noyes, is an impressive discussion of evolution as related
to God.</p>

<p>Perhaps another reason why these themes have not
been utilized in poetry is because they are too fantastic,
too bizarre. They lack the proportion and sense of artistic
harmony that poetry requires. Strangeness and wonder
are true elements of poetry, and magic is an element of the
greatest art, but in solution as it were, not in the form
observed in science. The miracles of the laboratory are
too abrupt, too inconceivable save by intellectual analysis,
and present too great a strain upon the powers of the
imagination. They are fantastic, while true poetry is
concerned with the fancy. Magic and wonder in verse
must come from concepts that steal upon the imagination
and make appeal through the emotions. Thus some forms
of supernaturalism are admirably adapted to the province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of poetry, such as the presence of spirits, visitations of
angels or demons, ancient witchcraft, and so forth. The
elements that have universal appeal through the sense of
the supernatural move us in poetry, but the isolated
instances, the peculiar problems that occur in scientific
research if transferred to poetry would leave us cold.
Yet they may come to be used in the next <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers libre</i>.</p>

<p>Nor do these situations come over into the drama save
in rare instances. Theodore Dreiser, in a recent volume,
<cite>Plays of the Natural and the Supernatural</cite>, makes use of
certain motifs that are striking and modern, as<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> where
a physician goes on the operating-table, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis
personæ</i> including Demyaphon (Nitrous Acid), and
Alcepheron (a Power of Physics), as well as several
Shadows, mysterious personages of vagueness. These
Shadows here, as in <cite>The Blue Sphere</cite>, are not altogether
clear as to motivation, yet they seem to stand for Fate
interference in human destiny. In the latter play Fate
is also represented by a Fast Mail which is one of the
active characters, menacing and destroying a child.</p>

<p>One reason why these motifs of science are not used
in drama to any extent is that they are impossible of
representation on the stage. Even the wizardry of modern
producers would be unable to show a Power of Physics,
or Nitrous Acid, save as they might be embodied, as were
the symbolic characters in Maeterlinck&rsquo;s <cite>Blue Bird</cite>, which
would mean that they would lose their effect. And what
would a stage manager do with the rhythm of the universe,
which enters into Dreiser&rsquo;s play? Many sounds can be
managed off stage, but hardly that, one fancies. These
themes are not even found in closet drama, where many
other elements of supernaturalism which would be difficult
or impossible of presentation on the stage trail off. William
Sharp&rsquo;s <cite>Vistas</cite>, for instance, could not be shown on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the stage, yet the little plays in that volume are of wonderful
dramatic power. The drama can stand a good deal of
supernaturalism of various kinds, from the visible ghosts
and devils of the Elizabethans to the atmospheric supernaturalism
of Maeterlinck, but it could scarcely support
the presentations of chemicals and gases and supernatural
botany and biology that fiction handles with ease. The
miraculous machinery would balk at stage action. Fancy
the Time Machine staged, for instance!</p>

<p>We notice in these scientific stories a widening of the
sphere of supernatural fiction. It is extended to include
more of the normal interests and activities of man than
has formerly been the case. Here we notice a spirit
similar to that of the leveling influence seen in the
case of the ghosts, devils, witches, angels, and so forth,
who have been made more human not only in appearance
but in emotions and activities as well. Likewise these
scientific elements have been elevated to the human.
Supernatural as well as human attributes have been
extended to material things, as animals are given supernormal
powers in a sense different from and yet similar
to those possessed by the enchanted animals in folk-lore.
Science has its physical as well as psychic horrors which
the scientific ghostly tales bring in.</p>

<p>Not only are animals gifted with supernatural powers
but plants as well are humanized, diabolized. We have
strange murderous trees, vampire orchids, flowers that
slay men in secret ways with all the smiling loveliness of a
treacherous woman. The dæmonics of modern botany
form an interesting phase of ghostly fiction and give a
new thrill to supernaturalism. Inanimate, concrete things
are endowed with unearthly cunning and strength, as well
as animals and plants. The new type of fiction gives to
chemicals and gases a hellish intelligence, a diabolic force
of minds. It creates machinery and gives it an excess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
force, a supernatural, more than human cunning, sometimes
helpful, sometimes dæmonic. Machines have been
spiritualized and some engines are philanthropic while
some are like damned souls.</p>

<p>This scientific supernaturalism concerns itself with
mortal life, not with immortality as do some of the other
aspects of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i>. It is concrete in its effects, not
spiritual. Its incursions into futurity are earthly, not of
heaven or hell, and its problems are of time, not of eternity.
The form shows how clear, cold intelligence plays
with miracles and applies the supernatural to daily life.
The enthusiasm, wild and exaggerated in some ways, that
sprang up over the prospects of what modern science and
investigation would almost immediately do for the world
in the latter half of the nineteenth century, had no more
interesting effect than in the stimulating of scientific
fictive supernaturalism. And though mankind has
learned that science will not immediately bring the
millennium, science still exercises a strong power over
fiction. This type shows a strange effect of realism in
supernaturalism, because of the scientific methods, for
supernaturalism imposed on material things produces an
effect of verisimilitude not gained in the realm of pure
spirit. Too intellectually cold for the purposes of poetry,
too abstract and elusive for presentation in drama, and
too removed by its association with the fantastic aspects
of investigation and the curiosities of science to be very
appropriate for tragedy, which has hitherto been the
chief medium of expressing the dramatic supernatural,
science finds its fitting expression in prose fiction. It is
an illustration of the widening range of the supernatural
in fiction and as such is significant.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="stl">Conclusion</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the previous chapters I have endeavored to show the
continuance and persistence of the supernatural in
English fiction, as well as in other forms of literature,
and to give some idea of the variety of its manifestations.
There has been no period in our history from Beowulf
to the present when the ghostly was not found in our
literature. Of course, there have been periods when the
interest in it waned, yet it has never been wholly absent.
There is at the present a definite revival of interest in the
supernatural appearing in the drama, in poetry and in
fiction, evident to anyone who has carefully studied the
recent publications and magazines. Within the last
few years, especially in the last two years, an astonishing
amount of ghostly material has appeared. Some of these
stories are of the hoax variety, others are suggestive, allegorical
or symbolic, while others frankly accept the forces
beyond man&rsquo;s mortal life and human dominion. I
hesitate to suggest a reason for this sudden rising tide of
occultism at this particular time, but it seems clear to me
that the war has had much to do with it. I have found
a number of supernatural productions directly associated
with the struggle. Among them might be mentioned
Katherine Fullerton Gerould&rsquo;s extraordinary, elusive
story of horror<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>; <cite>The Second Coming</cite>, by Frederick Arnold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Kummer and Henry P. Janes, where Christ walks the
battlefields on Christmas Eve, pleading with the Kaiser
to stop the slaughter of men, but in vain, and the carnage
goes on till Easter, when the Christ stands beside the
dying Emperor, with the roar of the rioting people heard
in the streets outside, and softens his heart at last, so
that he says, &ldquo;Lord, I have sinned! Give my people
peace!&rdquo;; Kipling&rsquo;s ghost-story,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> with its specters of children
slain by the Germans; <cite>The Gray Guest</cite>, showing
Napoleon returning to lead the French forces to victory
in a crisis; <cite>Jeanne, the Maid</cite> where the spirit of Joan of
Arc descends upon a young French girl of to-day, enabling
her to do wonderful things for her countrymen; <cite>War Letters
from a Living Dead Man</cite>, a series of professed psychic
communications from the other world, by Elsa Barker;
<cite>Real Ghost Stories</cite>, a volume containing a number of stories
by different writers, describing some of the phantoms
seen by soldiers on the battlefield; and Arthur Machen&rsquo;s
<cite>The Bowmen</cite>, a collection of striking fictive instances
of crowd-supernaturalism associated with the war. The
last volume affords an interesting glimpse into the
way in which legends are built up, for it is a contemporary
legend in connection with the Angels at
Mons. Carl Hauptmann has a striking play,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> showing
the use of war-supernaturalism in the drama. When
the eyes of the world are turned toward the battlefields
and death is an ever-present reality, it is natural that
human thoughts occupy themselves with visions of a life
after death. <cite>Kingdom Come</cite>, by Vida Sutton, shows
the spirits of Russian peasants slain for refusing to fight,
specters unaware that they are dead. Various martial
heroes of the past are resurrected to give inspiration in
battle in recent stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>But whatever be the reason for this revival of the
ghostly, the fact remains that this is distinctly the day
for the phantom and his confrères. While romanticism
is always with us, it appears in different manifestations.
A few years ago the swashbuckling hero and his adventures
seemed the most striking survival of the earlier
days of romanticism, but now the weird and the ghostly
have regained a popularity which they never surpassed
even in the heyday of Gothic fiction. The slashing
sword has been displaced by the psychographic pen.
The crucial struggles now are occult, rather than adventurous,
as before, and while realism in fiction is immensely
popular&mdash;never more so than now&mdash;it is likely to
have supernaturalism overlaid upon it, as in De Morgan&rsquo;s
work, to give a single example. Recent poetry manifests
the same tendency, and likewise the drama, particularly
the closet drama and the playlet. While literary history
shows clearly the continuity of the supernatural, with
certain rise and fall of interest in it at different periods,
it is apparent that now there is a more general fondness
for the form than at any other period in English literature.
The supernatural is in solution and exists everywhere.
Recent poetry shows a strong predilection for the uncanny,
sometimes in the manner of the old ballads, while
in other instances the ghostly is treated with a spirit of
critical detachment as in Rupert Brooke&rsquo;s sonnet,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> or
with skepticism as in his sardonic satire on faith.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> In
the recent volume of Brooke&rsquo;s collected poems, there are
about a dozen dealing with the supernatural. Maeterlinck
expressed the feeling that a spiritual epoch is perhaps
upon us, as Poe said that we are in the midst of great
psychal powers. As Francis Thompson says in his
<cite>Hound of Heaven</cite>, &ldquo;Nature, poor step-dame, cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
slake our drought!&rdquo; The interest in certain lines of
thought which lead to the writing of supernatural fiction,
as Spiritualism or folk-lore, or science or psychical research,
may have the reflex action of arousing interest in
the subjects themselves. But at all events, there is no
lack of uncanny literature at present.</p>

<p>One feature of the modern supernatural literature as
distinguished from that of other periods, is in the matter
of length. Of course, the ballad and the folk-tale expressed
the ghostly in brief form, but the epic held the stage
longer, while in Elizabethan times the drama was the
preferred form as in the eighteenth century the Gothic
novel. During the nineteenth century, particularly the
latter half, the preference was decidedly for the short
story, while more recently the one-act play has come into
vogue. But in the last few years the supernatural novel
seems to be returning to favor, though without displacing
the shorter forms. Brevity has much to commend it as
a vehicle for the uncanny. The effect of the ghostly
may be attained with much more unity in a short story
or playlet than in a novel or long drama, for in the more
lengthy form much outside matter is necessarily included.
The whole plot could scarcely be made up of the unearthly,
for that would mean a weakening of power
through exaggeration, though this is sometimes found
to be the case, as in several of Bram Stoker&rsquo;s novels.
Recently the number of novels dealing with supernatural
themes has noticeably increased, which leads one to believe
that the occult is transcending even the limitations of
length and claiming all forms for its own. Now no
literary type bars the supernatural, which appears in the
novel as in the story, in the drama as in the playlet, and
in narrative, dramatic, and lyric poetry. Even the epic
of the more than mortal has not entirely vanished, as
the work of Dr. William Cleaver Wilkinson attests, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
popular taste does not really run to epics nowadays.
The ghostly is more often seen in the shorter forms, where
brevity gives a chance for compression and intensity of
force difficult in longer vehicles. The rise of the one-act
play in popular favor is significant in this connection.
The short dramas of Synge, Yeats, Lady Gregory, William
Sharpe, Gordon Bottomley, and Theodore Dreiser show
the possibilities of the playlet for weird effect. Maeterlinck&rsquo;s
plays for marionettes are especially powerful, but
the work of Lord Dunsany furnishes more peculiar ghostliness
than that of any other present dramatist. His jade
idols, for instance, that wake to terrible life and revenge
themselves on presumptuous mortals, are a new touch in
dramatics. Algernon Blackwood is doing more significant
work in psychic fiction than anyone else, his prose showing
poetic beauty as well as eerie power.</p>

<p>Another significant fact to be noted in connection with
the later ghostly stories as compared with the Gothic is in
the greater number and variety of materials employed.
The early religious plays had introduced devils, angels, and
divinity to a considerable extent, while the Elizabethan
drama relied for its thrills chiefly on the witch and the
revenge-ghost. The Gothic romance was strong for the
ghost, with one or two Wandering Jews, occasional werewolves
and lycanthropes, and sporadic satanity, but made
no use of angels or of divinity. The modern fiction,
however, gathers up all of these personages and puts them
into service freely. In addition to these old themes brought
up to date and varied astonishingly, the new fiction has
adapted other types. The scientific supernaturalism
is practically new&mdash;save for the Gothic employment of
alchemy and astrology&mdash;and now all the discoveries and
investigations of the laboratory are utilized and embued
with supernaturalism. Diabolic botany, psychological
chemistry, and supermortal biology appear in recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
fiction. The countless arts and sciences, acoustics,
optics, dietetics, and what-not are levied on for plots,
while astronomy shows us wonders the astrologer never
dreamed of. The stars knew their place and kept it in
early romance, but they are given to strange aberration
and unaccountable conduct in late narration.</p>

<p>The futuristic fiction gives us return trips into time
to come, while we may be transported into the far past, as
with Mark Twain&rsquo;s Connecticut Yankee that visits
King Arthur&rsquo;s Court. The extent to which a homespun
realist like Mark Twain uses the supernatural is significant.
No province or small corner of science has failed to furnish
material for the new ghostly fiction, and even the Fourth
and Fifth Dimensions are brought in as plot complications.
Microscopes are bewitched, mirrors are enchanted,
and science reverses its own laws at will to suit the weird
demands.</p>

<p>Another modern material is the mechanistic. This is
the age of machinery, and even engines are run by ghost-power.
Examples of the mechanical spook are legion.
There is the haunted automobile in Harriet Prescott
Spofford&rsquo;s story, <cite>The Mad Lady</cite>, that reproduces through
its speaking tube the long-dead voice, that runs away
with its occupants, reliving previous tragic experiences.
A phantom Ford is an idea combining romanticism with
realism surely! In connection with this extraordinary
car is a house that erects itself out of dreams and is
substantial enough for living purposes. Other specimens
are John Kendrick Bangs&rsquo;s enchanted typewriter that
clicks off psychograms in the dark, between midnight
and three o&rsquo;clock in the morning; Frank R. Stockton&rsquo;s
machine for negativing gravity; Poe&rsquo;s balloon in which
Hans Pfaal makes his magic trip to the moon; Wells&rsquo;s
new accelerator that condenses and intensifies vital energy,
enabling a man to crowd the forces of a week into an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of emergency, as likewise his time machine that permits
the inventor to project himself into the future or the past
at will, to spend a week-end in any era. The butterfly
in Hawthorne&rsquo;s story shows the spiritualization of machinery
as the poor artist of the beautiful conceived it, the
delicate toy imbibing a magnetism, a spiritual essence
that gives it life and beauty and power of voluntary motion.
This etherealized machinery is manifest in modern
fiction as well as the diabolic constructions that wreck
and ruin.</p>

<p>Inanimate objects have a strange power in later fiction
as Poe&rsquo;s ship that is said in certain seas to increase in size,
as the trees told of by Algernon Blackwood that grow in
the picture. There are various haunted portraits, as the
picture of Dorian Gray that bears on its face the lines
of sin the living face does not show, and whose hands
are bloodstained when Dorian commits murder; and the
painting told of in De Morgan&rsquo;s <cite>A Likely Story</cite>, that
overhears a quarrel between an artist and his wife, the
woman wrongly suspecting her husband and leaving him.
The picture relates the story to a man who has the painting
photographed and a copy sent to the wife. There is the
haunted tapestry<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> that is curiously related to the living
and to the long dead.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the later as distinguished from the
earlier occult literature is the attention paid to ghostly
children. Youngsters are coming to the front of the
stage everywhere nowadays, particularly in America, so
it is but natural that they should demand to be heard
as well as seen, in supernatural fiction. In the Gothic
ghosts I found no individualized children, and children
in groups only twice. In one of James Hogg&rsquo;s short
novels a vicious man is haunted on his death-bed by the
specters of little ones dead because of him, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
are nameless and indistinguishable. In Maturin&rsquo;s <cite>The Albigenses</cite>
a relentless persecutor, while passing through a
lonely forest, sees the phantoms of those he has done to
death, little children and babes at the breast, as well as men
and women. But here again they are not given separable
character, but are merely group figures, hence do not
count.</p>

<p>There is a ghost-child mentioned in Hawthorne&rsquo;s <cite>Blithedale
Romance</cite>, but it is not until more recent fiction that
children&rsquo;s ghosts enter personated and individualized.
The exquisitely shy little ones in Kipling&rsquo;s <cite>They</cite> are
among the most wonderful of his child-creations, very
human and lovable. In a war story,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> he shows us the
phantoms of several children whom the Germans have
killed, natural youngsters with appealing childish attributes,
especially the small boy with his pride in his first
trousers. Arthur Machen<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> tells of a German soldier who
has crucified a child against the church door and is driven to
insanity by the baby spirit. Quiller-Couch<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> shows the
specter of a little girl that returns at night to do housework
for the living, visible only as two slender hands, who reminds
us of the shepherd boy Richard Middleton tells of, who having
died because of his drunken father&rsquo;s neglect, comes back
to help him tend the sheep. Algernon Blackwood relates
the story of a little child who has been wont to pray for
the unquiet ghost of Petavel, a wicked man who haunts
his house. After the child is dead, the mother sees
the little boy leading Petavel by the hand, and says,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s leading him into peace and safety. Perhaps that&rsquo;s
why God took him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard Middleton&rsquo;s story of a little ghost-boy<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> is
poignantly pathetic. The little chap comes back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
play with his grieving sister, making his presence known
by his gay feet dancing through the bracken, and his
joyous imitations of an automobile&rsquo;s chug-chug. Mary
MacMillan speaks of the spirits of little children that are
&ldquo;out earlier at night than the older ghosts, you know,
because they have to go to bed earlier, being so young.&rdquo;
Two very recent child ghosts are Wee Brown Elsbeth
whom Frances Hodgson Burnett shows to us, the wraith
of a little girl pitifully slain centuries ago by her father to
save her from torture, who comes back to play with a
living playmate; and the terrible revenge-ghost of the
child slain by her stepfather, who comes back to cause his
death, whom Ellen Glasgow describes.</p>

<p>The spirits of children that never were enter into the
late stories, as in <cite>The Children</cite>, by Josephine Daskam Bacon,
a story of confused paranoia and supernaturalism. A woman
grieves over the children she never had till they assume
personality and being for her. They become so real that
they are finally seen by other children who wish to play
with them. This reminds us of Thomas Bailey Aldrich&rsquo;s
imagined child, Miss Mehitabel&rsquo;s son. Algernon Blackwood<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
shows us a multitude of baby spirits, with reaching
arms, pattering steps, and lisping voices, spirits of the
unborn that haunt childless women. The room which
they enter seems sacred with the potentialities of motherhood,
so that a man sleeping there sees his own dead
mother return to him among the babes. These ghosts
of little children that never were and never may be are
like the spirits of the yet to be born children in Maeterlinck&rsquo;s
dream-drama,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> where, in the Land of the Future,
the child-souls wait for the angel to summon them to
life. In these stories associating children with the ghostly
there is always a tender pathos, a sad beauty that is
appealing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>The spectral insect or animal is another innovation in
recent fiction, though there have been occasional cases
before, as Vergil&rsquo;s <cite>Culex</cite>, the story of the ghost of a gnat
killed thoughtlessly coming back to tell its murderer of
its sufferings in the insect hades. Robert W. Chambers
shows us several ghostly insects, a death&rsquo;s head moth that
is a presager of disaster, and a butterfly that brings a
murderer to justice, while Frederick Swanson in a story<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
makes a spectral insect a minister of fate. The most curdling
example, however, of the entomological supernaturalism,
is Richard Marsh&rsquo;s novel, <cite>The Beetle</cite>, a modernized
version of the ancient superstitions of Egypt, whereby
a priestess of Isis continues her mysterious, horrid life alternately
as a human being and as a beetle. This lively
scarab has mesmeric, magic power over mortals and by
its sensational shape-shifting furnishes complicating terror
to the plot.</p>

<p>The dog is frequently the subject of occult fiction,
more so than any other animal, perhaps because the dog
seems more nearly human than any save possibly the
horse. Mrs. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward shows us a
dog very much at home in heaven, while she has a ghost-dog
on earth coming back to march in a Decoration Day
parade beside his master. Isabel Howe Fisk in a drama
shows the Archangel Raphael accompanied by his dog,
a cavortive canine, not apparently archangelic. Ambrose
Bierce evokes one terrible revenge-ghost, a dog that
kills the murderer of his master, while<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Eden Phillpotts
represents a pack of spectral dogs that pursue the Evil
One over the earth till the Judgment Day, each being a
lost soul. A young girl&rsquo;s little unbaptized baby is thought
to be one of the number. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s Hound of the
Baskervilles is a terrifying canine of legendary power.
Kerfol by Edith Wharton shows the ghosts of five dogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
each carefully individualized,&mdash;a Chinese sleeve-dog, a
rough brindled bulldog, a long-haired white mongrel, a
large white pointer with one brown ear, and a small black
grayhound. These specters of animals that have been
killed by a jealous husband&mdash;he had the cheerful habit of
strangling every pet his wife cared for and laying it without
a word on her pillow&mdash;appear once a year on the anniversary
of the day on which the wife in desperation slew
him. They preserve a most undoglike silence and follow
the beholder with strange gaze. Kipling&rsquo;s dog Harvey is
a supernatural beast, but what he represents I have never
been able to determine. <cite>At the Gate</cite> is a recent story,
showing a great concourse of dogs just outside the portals
of heaven, unwilling to enter till their masters come to
join them.</p>

<p>The diabolic horse in Poe&rsquo;s <cite>Metzengerstein</cite> is a curious
composite of metempsychosis, haunted inanimate object,
and straight ghost, but at all events sufficiently terrifying
to the victim it pursued. Algernon Blackwood in Wendigo
has created a supernatural animal that flies through
the air and carries men away to insanity and death.
Henry Rideout shows the ghost of a white tiger, while
there are assorted elephant spooks, and Miss Burns in
her studies in Shropshire folk-tales relates stories of human
beings whose ghosts appear as animals suited to the
personality of the deceased, as bears, bulls, hogs, and so
forth. That adds a new terror to death!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not only are new materials introduced in the later
fiction of the uncanny but new types are stressed. In
addition to the weird stories told with direct aim and art&mdash;ghosts
for ghosts&rsquo; sake&mdash;there are tales where the supernatural
element is of secondary importance, being used
to teach some truth or ridicule some fallacy. The symbolistic,
humorous, and satiric methods abound in modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
occult fiction and when well done have a double effect,
that of primary supernatural impressiveness, and, in
addition, of the subtler purposes behind the stories.
Moralized legends, spiritual allegories such as Hawthorne
wrote with consummate art, have continued to the present
and form a contrast to the crude machinery of Gothic
horrors. The delicacy of suggestion, the power of
hinted ghostliness, though manifest in Shakespeare, are
really modern achievements, for no one save him attained
to them in earlier art. Mystic poetic fiction, spiritual
symbolism appears in much of the modern unearthly
writing. In certain cases it is interesting to note the
change of old mythological stories into moral allegory.
The plays and the stories of Lord Dunsany are peculiarly
symbolic and have the force of antique mythology made
instant and real. Yet they have a distinctive touch all
their own. For instance, the story of the king who goes
over the world seeking his lost yesterday, his dear past,
who is told by the weird keeper of the bygone years
that he cannot have it back, no not one golden second,
has a delicate pathos of poetry. When the mournful
king has gone back to his palace, a hoar harper comes
who plays for him, and lo! to the strings of the harp
have clung the golden seconds of his happiest hours, so
that he lives them over again while the music lasts.
<cite>The Book of the Serpent</cite> tells symbolic stories that are
poems in prose, fantastic fables. The Creator is making
experiments with dust-heaps, while the Serpent,
the Turtle, and the Grasshopper look on, ask questions,
and offer comments. The Serpent trails all through the
dust-heap meant as stuff for artists, and the Maker drops
a tear in that whereof He means to make mothers.
He experiments with monkeys trying to learn how best to
make man, and after man is complete, He makes woman.
The stories of Oscar Wilde have, some of them, a beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
like that of some antique illuminated missal, with its
jeweled words, its mystic figures. Wilde&rsquo;s ornate style,
prose that trembles on the verge of poetry, full of passion
and color and light, makes one think of his own words
in <cite>The Nightingale and the Rose</cite>, where the poet&rsquo;s song
was &ldquo;builded of music by moonlight and stained with
his own heart&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The delicate suggestion of the unearthly, the element
of suspense that gives the sense of the supernatural to
that which may be mortal, is seen in such stories as
<cite>A Dream of Provence</cite>, by Frederick Wedmore. The
ancient belief that the soul may return to the body within
a few days after death forms the basis for this dream-poem
in prose. It shows the soul on tiptoe for the Unseen,
with a love transcending the barriers of the grave, revealing
idyllic sorrow in a father&rsquo;s love that denies death, and
expresses the sense of expectancy in the hope of a miracle,
with a beauty that is almost unbearable. Something of
the same theme, of a father&rsquo;s waiting by his daughter&rsquo;s
grave to hear the loved voice once more, is expressed in
Andreyev&rsquo;s story.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> But here there is horror and remorse
instead of holy love. When the father cries out, the
silence that issues from the grave is more terrible than
ghostly sounds would be, more dreadful in its supermortal
suggestion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The purely humorous supernaturalism is essentially
a new thing. The old religious dramas had used comic
devils, and Peele&rsquo;s Ghost of Jack is supposed to be humorous,
but not at all in the modern sense. There was nothing
in early drama or fiction like the rollicking fun of Richard
Middleton&rsquo;s Ghost Ship, or Frank R. Stockton&rsquo;s spectral
humorists. The work of John Kendrick Bangs illustrates
the free and easy manner of the moderns toward ghosts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
picturing them in unconventional situations and divesting
them of all their ancient dignity. He shows us the
wraith of the maiden who drowned herself in a fit of pique,
for which she is punished by having to haunt the ancestral
house as a shower-bath. His spectral cook of Bangletop
is an original revenge-ghost, with a villainous inversion
of h&rsquo;s, who haunts an estate because a medieval baron
discharged her without wages. His convivial spooks in
their ghost club, his astrals who play pranks on mortals,
and their confrères are examples of the modern flippancy
toward supernaturals.</p>

<p>The satirical use of supernaturalism is also new. Late
literature laughs at everything, with a daring familiarity
undreamed of before, save in sporadic cases. The devil
has been an ancient subject for laughter, but recent fiction
ridicules him still more, so that we have scant respect
for him, while the ghost, formerly a personage held in
great respect, now comes in for his share of ragging. No
being is too sacred to escape the light arrows of fun.
Heaven is satirically exploited, and angels, saints, and even
Deity have become subjects for jesting, conventionalized
with the mother-in-law, the tenderfoot, the Irishman, and
so forth. There is a considerable body of anecdotal
literature of the supernatural, showing to what extent
the levity of treatment has gone. Various aspects of
mortal life are satirized, as in Inez Haynes Gilmore&rsquo;s
<cite>Angel Island</cite>, which is a campaign document for woman&rsquo;s
suffrage. Satiric supernaturalism is employed to drive
home many truths, to puncture conceits of all kinds,
and when well done is effective, for laughter is a clever
weapon.</p>

<p>The advance of the later supernatural fiction over the
earlier is nowhere seen more distinctly than in the increased
effectiveness with which it manages the mechanics
of emotion, its skill in selecting and elaborating the details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
by which terror and awe are produced. The present-day
artist of the uncanny knows how to strike the varied
tones of supernaturalism, the shrill notes of fear, the deep
diapason of awe, the crashing chords of horror. The
skillful writer chooses with utmost care the seemingly
trivial details that go to make up the atmosphere of the
unearthly. Shakespeare was a master of that, but none
other of his time. The knocking at the gate in <cite>Macbeth</cite>,
for instance, is a perfect example of the employment of a
natural incident to produce an effect of the supernatural,
as De Quincey has pointed out in his essay on the subject.</p>

<p>The Gothic novel relied largely for its impressiveness
on emphasizing ghostly scenes by representing aspects of
weather to harmonize with the emotions of the characters.
This was overworked in terror fiction, and while it still
possesses power it is a much less common method of
technique than it used to be. Poe&rsquo;s introductory paragraph
in <cite>The Fall of the House of Usher</cite> is a notable example
of skill in creating atmosphere of the supernatural by
various details including phenomena of weather, and
Hardy shows special power in harmonizing nature to the
moods and purposes of his characters. Yet many a
modern story produces a profound sense of awe, and
purges the soul by means of terror with no reference at all
to foreboding weather. However, the allusions now made
are more skillful and show more selective power than of
old.</p>

<p>Gothic fiction had much to say of melancholy birds
that circled portentously over ancient castles filled with
gloom and ghosts, but they were generic and not individual
specimens. The fowl was always spoken of as &ldquo;a bird of
prey,&rdquo; &ldquo;a night bird,&rdquo; &ldquo;a bat,&rdquo; &ldquo;an owl,&rdquo; or by some
such vague term. Natural history has become more
generally known since those times and writers of to-day
introduce their ominous birds with more definiteness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
appropriateness. The repulsive bat that clings to the
window ledge in Bram Stoker&rsquo;s novel is a vampire, a
symbol of the whole horrible situation, as the kite that
soars menacingly overhead in another of his novels is
individualized and becomes a definite thing of terror.
Poe&rsquo;s raven is vastly more a bird of evil than any specimen
in the Gothic aviary. Robert W. Chambers brings in a
cormorant several times as a portent of ghostly disaster,
particularly foreboding when it turns toward the land.
&ldquo;On the dark glistening cliffs, silhouetted against the
glare of the sea, sat a cormorant, black, motionless, its
horrible head raised toward heaven.&rdquo; There is in recent
fiction no bird more dreadful in import than the belled
buzzard that Irvin Cobb makes the leading figure in his
story by that name. This is an excellent example of the
use of the natural to produce terror and awe, for the murderer
sees in the bird a minister of fate, and the faint tinkle
of its bell as it soars over the marsh where the body lies
buried paralyzes him with horror. At last he can bear
no more, and hearing it, as he thinks, close at hand, he
shrieks out his confession,&mdash;only to find this time that it
is not the belled buzzard at all that he hears, but only an
old cowbell that a little negro child has picked up in the
barnyard!</p>

<p>Robert W. Chambers in his early stories contrives to
give varying supernatural effects by descriptions of
shadows as symbolic of life and character. He speaks of
shadows of spirits or of persons fated to disaster as white;
again his supernatural shadows may be gray&mdash;gray is a
favored shade for ghostly effect whether for witches or for
phantoms&mdash;and sometimes they are perfectly black, to
indicate differing conditions of destiny. Quiller-Couch
has a strange little allegory, <cite>The Magic Shadow</cite>, and other
writers have used similar methods to produce uncanny
effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>The Gothic romance made much use of portents of the
supernatural, which later fiction does as well, but differently
and with greater skill. The modern stories for the
most part abandon the conventional portents, the dear old
clock forever striking twelve or one&mdash;there was no Gothic
castle so impoverished as to lack such ghostly horologue!&mdash;the
abbey bell that tolls at touch of spirit hands or wizard
winds, the statuesque nose-bleed, the fire that burns
blue at approach of a specter, and so forth. The later
story is more selective in its aids to ghostly effect, and
adapts the means desired to each particular case, so that
it hits the mark. For instance, the sardonic laughter
that sounds as the burglars are cracking the gate of
heaven to get in, and imagining what they will find, is
prophetic of the emptiness, the nothingness, that meets
their astounded gaze when they are within. Ambrose
Bierce in some of his stories describes the repulsiveness of
the fleshly corpse, reanimated by the spirit, perhaps not
the spirit belonging to it, with a loathly effect more awful
than any purely psychic phantom could produce, which
reminds us somewhat of the corpse come to life in Thomas
Lovell Beddoes&rsquo;s <cite>Death&rsquo;s Jest Book</cite>.</p>

<p>The horrors of invisibility in modern fiction avail to
give a ghastly chill to the soul that visible apparitions
rarely impart. Likewise the effect of mystery, of the
incalculable element, in giving an impression of supernaturalism
is a recognized method of technique in many
stories, as the minister&rsquo;s black veil in Hawthorne&rsquo;s symbolic
story. The unspeakable revolting suggestion in
Edith Wharton&rsquo;s <cite>The Eyes</cite>, where a man is haunted by
two hideous eyes that &ldquo;have the physical effect of a bad
smell, whose look left a smear like a snail,&rdquo; is built up with
uncommon art. We do not realize how much is due to
insanity and how much to the supernatural, when, after
telling the story of his obsession, his fears that as a climax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
he will become like those Eyes, the man suddenly sees
his reflection in the mirror and meets their dreadful
gaze. &ldquo;He and the image confronted each other with a
glare of slowly gathering hate!&rdquo; Mention might be made
of an incident in a recently published literary drama,
where a man seeks over the world for the unknown woman
with whom he has fallen in love, and on his calling aloud
in question as to who she is, &ldquo;the grave, with nettle-bearded
lips replied, &lsquo;It is I, Death!&rsquo;&rdquo; These are only
suggestions of numberless instances that might be given
of a modern technique of supernaturalism that surpasses
anything in Gothic fiction.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of modern ghostly stories is aided by
the suggestiveness of the unearthly given by the use of
&ldquo;sensitives,&rdquo; animals or persons that are peculiarly alert
to the occult impressions. We see in many stories that
children perceive the supernatural presences more quickly
than adults, as in Mrs. Oliphant&rsquo;s story of the ghost
returning to right a wrong, trying strenuously to make
herself known to the grown person and realized only by a
little child. In Belasco&rsquo;s play the little boy is the first
and for a long time the only one to sense the return of
Peter Grimm. In Maeterlinck&rsquo;s <cite>The Blind</cite>, the baby in
arms is aware of the unearthly presences better than the
men and women. Sometimes the sensitive is a blind
person, as the old grandfather in another of Maeterlinck&rsquo;s
short plays, who is conscious of the approaching
Death before any of the others, or blind Anna in D&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s
drama, <cite>The Dead City</cite>.</p>

<p>Animals are quick to perceive supernatural manifestations.
Cats in fiction are shown as being at ease in the
presence of ghosts perhaps because of their uncanny
alliance with witches, while dogs and horses go wild with
fear. This is noticed in many stories, as in Bulwer-Lytton&rsquo;s
story of the haunted house where the dog dies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
terror in the face of the ghostly phenomena. The Psychic
Doctor told of in Blackwood&rsquo;s uncanny stories, who
goes to a house possessed by evil spirits, takes with him a
cat and a dog which by their difference of action reveal
to him the presence of the spirits long before they are
visualized for him.</p>

<p>In general, there is more power of suggestion in the
later ghostly stories than in the earlier. The art is more
subtle, the technique more skillfully studied, more artfully
accidental.</p>

<p>There is in modern fiction, notably the work of Poe, and
that of many recent writers, Russian, French, and German
as well as English, a type of supernaturalism that is closely
associated with insanity. One may not tell just where
the line is drawn, just how much of the element of the
uncanny is the result of the broodings of an unbalanced
brain, and how much is real ghostliness. Poe&rsquo;s studies
of madness verge on the unearthly, as do Maupassant&rsquo;s,
Hoffmann&rsquo;s, and others. Josephine Daskam Bacon illustrates
this genre in a recent volume of stories, <cite>The Strange
Cases of Dr. Stanchion</cite>, the plots centering round instances
of paranoia occurring in the practice of a famous alienist,&mdash;yet
they are <em>not paranoia alone</em>! One instance is of a
young girl who is haunted by the ghost of a nurse who has
died because given the wrong medicine by mistake.
She is on the border-line of insanity when her lover cries
aloud that he would take the curse on himself for her if
he could, which, by some unknown psychic law, does
effect a transference which frees her and obsesses him.
Another is that of a man in the insane asylum, who
recognizes in a mysterious housekeeper the spirit of his
wife, who comes from the grave to keep him company
and vanishes on the day of his death. These are curious
analyses of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idée fixe</i> in its effect on the human mind,
of insanity as a cause or effect of the supernatural. Barry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Pain&rsquo;s <cite>Celestial Grocery</cite> is a recent example, a story of a
man whose madness carries him to another planet, showing
him inverted aspects of life, where emotions are the only
real things, all else but shadows. Du Maurier&rsquo;s pathetic
novel portraying the passion and anguish and joy of Peter
Ibbetson that touches the thin line between sanity and
madness, showing in his dream-metempsychosis a power
to relive the past and even to live someone else&rsquo;s life, is
a striking example. One interesting aspect of that story
is the point where the spirit of Mary changes from the
dream-lover of twenty-eight to the ghost of the woman of
fifty-two, since she has died and can no more come to her
lover as she once did, but must come as her own phantom.
There are extraordinary effects of insanity associated
with the supernatural in the work of Ambrose Bierce, of
Arthur Machen and others of the modern school. Italian
literature shows some significant instances in Fogazzaro&rsquo;s
<cite>The Woman</cite> and D&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sogno d&rsquo;un Mattino di
Primavera</cite>. As Lord Dunsany says of it, &ldquo;Who can say
of insanity,&mdash;whether it be divine or of the Pit?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have noticed in preceding chapters two aspects of
modern supernaturalism as distinguished from the Gothic,&mdash;the
giving of cumulative and more terrible power to
ghostly beings, and on the other hand the leveling influence
that makes them more human. The access of horror
and unearthly force as shown in the characters described
by certain writers is significant. In the work of Bierce,
Machen, Blackwood, Stoker, and others supernaturalism
is raised to the nth power and every possible thrill is employed.
The carrion ghosts of Bierce, animated by malignant
foreign spirits, surpass the charnel shudders produced
by the Gothic. Algernon Blackwood&rsquo;s Psychic Invasions,
where localities rather than mere apartments or houses
alone are haunted, diabolized by undying evil influences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
with compound power, his Elementals that control the
forces of wind and wave and fire to work their demon
will, are unlike anything that the early terror novel conceived
of. Horace Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe knew no
thrills like those of Bram Stoker&rsquo;s Count Dracula who is
an immemorial evil, a vampire and werewolf as well as
man, with power to change himself into a vampire bat
or animal of prey at will. <cite>The Unburied</cite>, by Josephine
Daskam Bacon, is more horrific than any mere revenge
ghost, however much it shrieked &ldquo;Vindicta!&rdquo; The diabolism
in Arthur Machen&rsquo;s work reeks obscurely of a
Pit more horrible than epic or drama has portrayed. In
general, many of the later ghostly characters are more
complex, more intense in evil than the Gothic.</p>

<p>While it is true that certain writers show a tendency to
create supernatural characters having an excess of evil
power beyond the previous uncanny beings, on the other
hand there is an equally strong and significant tendency
to reduce the ghostly beings nearer to the human. Fiction
here, as frequently, seems ahead of general belief, and
refuses to believe in the altogether evil. Ghosts, angels,
witches, devils, werewolves, and so forth are now made
more human, more like to man, yet without losing any of
their ancient power to thrill. Ghosts in late literature
have more of the mortal characteristics than ever before,
as has been pointed out in a previous chapter. They
look more human, more normal, they are clad in everyday
garments of varied colors, from red shirts and khaki
riding-habits to ball-gowns,&mdash;though gray seems the
favored shade for shades as well as witches,&mdash;and they
have lost that look of pallor that distinguished early
phantoms. Now they are more than merely vaporous
projections as they used to be, more than merely phantasmogenetic
apparitions,&mdash;but are healthy, red-blooded
spooks. They are not tongue-tied as their ancestors were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
but are very chatty, giving forth views on everything they
are interested in, from socialism to the present war. And
their range of interests has widened immeasurably. It
would seem that the literacy test has been applied to
ghosts in recent fiction. Modern specters are so normal
in appearance that often no one recognizes them as ghosts,&mdash;as
in Edith Wharton&rsquo;s story <cite>Afterwards</cite>, where the
peculiar thing about the apparition haunting a certain
house is that it is not till long afterwards that one knows
it was a ghost. The man in the gray suit whom the wife
thinks a chance caller is the spirit of a man not yet dead,
a terrible living revenge-ghost, who finally takes his
victim mysteriously away with him. Modern ghosts
have both motions and emotions like men, hence mortals
are coming to regard them more sympathetically, to
have more of a fellow-feeling for them.</p>

<p>Likewise the angels are now only a very little higher
if any than men. Seraphs are democratic, and angels
have developed a sense of humor that renders them more
interesting than they used to be. The winged being that
H.&nbsp;G. Wells&rsquo;s vicar goes gunning for is a charming youth
with a naïve satire, as the angels in Mark Twain&rsquo;s
story of heaven are realistically mortal and masculine
in tastes. They care little for harps and crowns, grow
fidgety under excess of rest, and engage in all sorts
of activities, retaining their individual tastes. James
Stephens&rsquo;s archangel, seraph, and cherub are chatty,
cordial souls with an avidity for cold potatoes and Irish
companionship.</p>

<p>The demons as well have felt the same leveling
influence experienced by the ghosts and the angels.
Only, in their case, the thing is reversed, and they are
raised to the grade of humanity. We are coming to see,
in modern fiction, at least, that the devil is not really
black, only a pleasant mottled gray like ourselves. Satan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
in Mark Twain&rsquo;s posthumous novel,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> is an affable young
fellow, claiming to be the nephew and namesake of the
personage best known by that name. Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s
devil is of a Chesterfieldian courtesy, willing to speed
the parting as to welcome the coming guest. I have found
no comic use of the werewolf or of the vampire, though
there are several comic witch stories, yet all these personages
are humanized in modern fiction. We feel in some
recent supernatural stories a sense of a continuing current
of life. These ghosts, devils, witches, angels, and so
forth are too real to be cut short by an author&rsquo;s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Finis</i>.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the leveling influence is seen in the
more than natural power of motion, feeling, and intelligence
given to inanimate objects, machinery, plants, and
animals, in late literature. The idea of endowing inanimate
figures with life and personality is seen several
times in Hawthorne&rsquo;s stories, as his snow image, Drowne&rsquo;s
wooden image, the vivified scarecrow, Feathertop, that
the witch makes. The clay figures that Satan in Mark
Twain&rsquo;s novel models, endues with life, then destroys with
the fine, casual carelessness of a god, remind one of an
incident from mythology. The statue in Edith Wharton&rsquo;s
<cite>The Duchess at Prayer</cite> that changes its expression, showing
on its marble face through a century the loathing and
horror that the living countenance wore, or Lord Dunsany&rsquo;s
jade idol<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> that comes with stony steps across
the desolate moor to exact vengeance on four men helpless
in its presence, has a more intense thrill than Otranto&rsquo;s
peripatetic statue. Lord Dunsany&rsquo;s <cite>The Gods of the
Mountains</cite>, of which Frank Harris says, &ldquo;It is the only
play which has meant anything to me in twenty years,&rdquo;
shows an inexorable fatality as in the Greek drama.</p>

<p>Science is revealing wonderful facts and fiction is quick
to realize the possibilities for startling situations in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
field. So diabolic botanical specimens, animals endowed
with human or more than human craft&mdash;sometimes gifted
with immortality as well&mdash;add a new interest to uncanny
fiction. And the new machines that make all impossibilities
come to pass inspire a significant class of supernatural
stories. In general, a new force is given to all
things, to raise them to the level of the human.</p>

<p>In the same way nature is given a new power and
becomes man&rsquo;s equal,&mdash;sometimes far his superior&mdash;in
thought and action. The maelstrom in Poe&rsquo;s story
is more than merely a part of the setting,&mdash;it is a terrible
force in action. Algernon Blackwood stresses this variously
in his stories, as where Egypt is shown as a vital
presence and power, or where the &ldquo;goblin trees&rdquo; are as
awful as any of the other characters of evil, or in the
wind and flame on the mountain that are elements of
supernatural power, with a resistless lure for mortals, or
in the vampire soil that steals a man&rsquo;s strength. This
may be illustrated as well from the drama, as in Maeterlinck&rsquo;s
where Death is the silent, invisible, yet dominant
force, or in Synge&rsquo;s where the sea is a terrible foe, lying
in wait for man, or in August Stramm&rsquo;s <cite>The Daughter
of the Moor</cite>, where the moor is a compelling character
of evil. Gothic fiction did associate the phenomena of
nature with the moods of the action, yet in a less effective
way. The aspects of nature in recent literature have
been raised to the level of humanity, becoming mortal or
else diabolic or divine.</p>

<p>In general, in modern fiction, man now makes his supernatural
characters in his own image. Ghosts, angels,
devils, witches, werewolves, are humanized, made like
to man in appearance, passions, and powers. On the
other hand, plants, inanimate objects, and animals, as
well as the phenomena of nature, are raised to the human
plane and given access of power. This leveling process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
democratizes the supernatural elements and tends to
make them almost equal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The present revival of interest in the supernatural and
its appearance in literature are as marked in the drama as
in fiction or poetry. Mr. E.&nbsp;C. Whitmore, in a recently
published volume on <cite>The Supernatural in Tragedy</cite>, has
ably treated the subject, especially in the Greek classic
period and the Elizabethan age in England. His thesis
is that the supernatural is most frequently associated
with tragedy, and is found where tragedy is at its best.
This may be true of earlier periods of the tragic drama,
yet it would be going too far to make the assertion of the
drama of the present time. The occult makes its appearance
to a considerable extent now in melodrama and
even in comedy, though with no decrease in the frequency
and effectiveness of its use in tragedy. This only illustrates
the widening of its sphere and its adaptability to
varying forms of art.</p>

<p>A brief survey of some of the plays produced in the last
few years, most of them being seen in New York, will
illustrate the extent to which the ghostly motifs are used
on the stage of to-day. Double personality is represented<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
by Edward Locke, in a play which is said by critics to be
virtually a dramatization of Dr. Morton Prince&rsquo;s study,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
where psychological apparatus used in laboratory experiments
to expel the evil intruder from the girl, a chronoscope,
a dynograph, revolving mirrors, make the setting
seem truly psychical. But the most dramatic instance
of the kind, of course, is the dramatization of Dr. Jekyll&rsquo;s
alter ego.</p>

<p>The plays of Charles Rann Kennedy<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and Jerome K.
Jerome<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> are akin to the old mystery plays in that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
personate divinity and show the miracle of Christly
influence on sinful hearts. Augustus Thomas<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and
Edward Milton Royle<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> introduce hypnotism as the basis
of complication and denouement. Supernatural healing,
miraculous intervention of divine power, occur in plays
by William Vaughan Moody,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Björnson,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and George
M. Cohan.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Another<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> turns on converse with spirits,
as does Belasco&rsquo;s <cite>Return of Peter Grimm</cite>, while a war
play by Vida Sutton<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> shows four ghosts on the stage at
once, astonishing phantoms who do not realize that they
are dead. Others<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> have for their themes miracles of
faith and rescue from danger, though the first-named play
satirizes such belief and the latter is a piece of Catholic
propaganda.</p>

<p><cite>Magic</cite>, by G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton, introduces supernatural
forces whereby strange things are made to happen, such
as the changing of the electric light from green to blue.
<cite>Peter Ibbetson</cite>, the dramatization of Du Maurier&rsquo;s novel,
shows dream-supernaturalism, and various other psychic
effects in a delicate and distinctive manner. And <cite>The
Willow Tree</cite>, by Benrimo and Harrison Rhodes, is built
upon an ancient Japanese legend, relating a hamadryad
myth with other supermortal phantasies, such as representing
a woman&rsquo;s soul as contained in a mirror.</p>

<p>We have fairy plays by J.&nbsp;M. Barrie,<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> W.&nbsp;B. Yeats,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and
Maeterlinck,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and the mermaid has even been staged,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Bernard Shaw shows us the devil in his own home town,
while Hauptmann gives us Hannele&rsquo;s visions of heaven.
The Frankenstein theme is used to provoke laughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
mixed with thrills.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Owen and Robert Davis<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> symbolize
man&rsquo;s better angel, while <cite>The Eternal Magdalene</cite>,
a dream-drama, shows another piece of symbolic supernaturalism.
Lord Dunsany&rsquo;s plays have already been
mentioned.</p>

<p>Yet the drama, though showing a definite revival of the
supernatural, and illustrating various forms of it, is more
restricted than fiction. Many aspects of the occult
appear and the psychic drama is popular, but the necessities
of presentation on the stage inevitably bar many
forms of the ghostly art that take their place naturally
in fiction. The closet drama does not come under this
limitation, for in effect it is almost as free as fiction to introduce
mystical, symbolic, and invisible presences. The
closet drama is usually in poetic form and poetry is closer
akin to certain forms of the supernatural than is prose,
which makes their use more natural.</p>

<p>The literary playlet, so popular just now, uses the ghostly
in many ways. One shows the Archangel Raphael with
his dog, working miracles, while another includes in its
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> a faun and a moon goddess who insists
on giving the faun a soul, at which he wildly protests. As
through suffering and human pain he accepts the gift, a
symbolic white butterfly poises itself on his uplifted hand,
then flits toward Heaven. In another, Padraic yields
himself to the fairies&rsquo; power as the price of bread for the
girl he loves. Theodore Dreiser&rsquo;s short plays bring in
creatures impossible of representation on the stage,
&ldquo;persistences&rdquo; of fish, animals, and birds, symbolic
Shadows, a Blue Sphere, a Power of Physics, Nitrous
Acid, a Fast Mail (though trains have been used on the
stage), and so forth.</p>

<p>Instances from recent German drama might be given,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
as the work of August Stramm, who like Rupert Brooke
and the ill-starred poets of the Irish revolution has
fallen as a sacrifice to the war. An article in the <cite>Literary
Digest</cite> says of Stramm that &ldquo;he felt behind all the beauty
of the world its elemental passions and believed these to
be the projections of human passions in the waves of
wind and light and water, in flames of earth.&rdquo; He includes
among his characters<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> a Spider, Nightingales,
Moonlight, Wind, and Blossoms. Carl Hauptmann<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
likewise shows the elemental forces of nature and of
super-nature. On the battlefield of death the dead arise
to join in one dreadful chant of hate against their enemies.</p>

<p>Leonid Andreyev&rsquo;s striking play<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> might be mentioned
as an example from the Russian. King-Hunger, Death, and
Old time Bell-Ringer, are the principal actors, while the
human beings are all deformed and distorted, &ldquo;one continuous
malicious monstrosity bearing only a remote
likeness to man.&rdquo; The starving men are slain, but over
the field of the dead the motionless figure of Death is seen
silhouetted. But the dead arise, and a dull, distant,
manifold murmur, as if underground, is heard, &ldquo;We come!
Woe unto the victorious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as I have said, these are literary dramas, impossible
of presentation on the stage, so that they are judged by
literary rather than dramatic standards. For the most
part fiction is infinitely freer in its range and choice of
subjects from the supernatural than is the drama. The
suggestive, symbolic, mystic effects which could not in
any way be presented on the stage, but which are more
truly of the province of poetry, are used in prose that has
a jeweled beauty and a melody as of poetry. Elements
such as invisibility, for instance, and various occult
agencies may be stressed and analyzed in fiction as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
would be impossible on the stage. The close relation
between insanity and the weird can be much more effectively
shown in the novel or short story than in the drama,
as the forces of mystery, the incalculable agencies can
be thus better emphasized. Ghosts need to be seen on
the stage to have the best effect, even if they are meant
as &ldquo;selective apparitions&rdquo; like Banquo, and if thus
seen they are too corporeal for the most impressive influence,
while in fiction they can be suggested with delicate
reserve. Supernatural presences that could not be
imaged on the boards may be represented in the novel or
story, as Blackwood&rsquo;s Elementals or Psychic Invasions.
How could one stage such action, for instance, as his
citizens turning into witch-cats or his Giant Devil looming
mightily in the heavens? Likewise in fiction the full presentation
of scientific supernaturalism can be achieved,
which would be impossible on the stage.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it might be said that fiction offers the
most popular present vehicle for expression of the undoubtedly
reviving supernaturalism in English literature.
And fiction is likewise the best form, that which affords
the more varied chances for effectiveness. The rising tide
of the unearthly in art shows itself in all literary forms,
as dramatic, narrative, and lyric poetry, with a few epics&mdash;in
the playlet as in the standard drama, in the short story
as in the novel. It manifests itself in countless ways in
current literature and inviting lines of investigation suggest
themselves with reference to various aspects of its study.
The supernatural as especially related to religion offers
an interesting field for research. The miracles from the
Bible are often used, as in Lew Wallace&rsquo;s <cite>Ben Hur</cite>, and
Christ is introduced in other times and places, as the war
novel,<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> or in Marie Corelli&rsquo;s satire on Episcopacy,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> where
the cardinal finds the Christ child outside the cathedral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
The more than mortal elements, as answers to prayer, the
experience of conversion, spiritual miracles, and so forth,
are present to a considerable extent in modern fiction.
Two very recent novels of importance base their plots on
the miraculous in religion, <cite>The Brook Kerith</cite>, by George
Moore, and <cite>The Leather-wood God</cite>, by William Dean
Howells. I have touched on this aspect of the subject
in a previous article.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>One might profitably trace out the appearances of the
ghostly in modern poetry, or one might study its manifestations
in the late drama, including melodrama and
comedy as well as tragedy. This present treatment of the
supernatural in modern English fiction makes no pretensions
to being complete. It is meant to be suggestive
rather than exhaustive, and I shall be gratified if it may
help to arouse further interest in a significant and vital
phase of our literature and lead others to pursue the
investigations.</p>

If necessary, these same words were also corrected in the index.</p>

<p>Otherwise the original was preserved, including unusual, archaic
or inconsistent spelling and hyphenation. The index was not checked
for errors in alfabetisation or page numbers. The subtitle of Chapter
III was formatted different from the others in the original, this has
not been changed. Some of the lemma&rsquo;s in the index appear to be
identical, but they are probably meant to refer to different books with
the same title.</p>
